Alternative times available by appointment.\nBio: My name is June. I am a geographer, researcher, and educator who has been living as an uninvited guest on unceded Coast Salish Territory since 2015. I received a PhD in geography from UBC in 2022 and am now working for the UBC Micrometeorology group. I study greenhouse gas exchange in wetland ecosystems and associated feedback mechanisms that influence the earth’s climate system. My principal aims this semester are to give you a broad overview to the dynamics governing of weather and climate and to provide you with a supportive learning environment."

My undergraduate thesis research investigated the impacts of fire on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes (CO2, CH4, and N2O) within different burned zones of a bog. The methodology incorporated chamber measurements and gas chromatography for the analysis. Currently, as a second-year MSc student, I am examining the impacts of seedling removal — a post-fire management practice — on the GHG fluxes (CO2 and CH4) within the 2016 burned zone of the Burns Bog, Delta, BC. This research utilizes a smart chamber with a portable analyzer. Additionally, I am interested in quantifying the net carbon exchange at the ecosystem scale using eddy covariance techniques and understanding carbon dynamics across varying ecosystem types."
