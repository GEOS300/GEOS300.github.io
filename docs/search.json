Gamma is 0.00 (January 1), 1.38 (March 22), 2.94 (June 21), and 6.27 (December 31).\nDeclination changes throughout the year, but for a given date it is the same for the whole planet. \\(\\delta\\) is \\(0^{\\circ}\\) during the vernal and autumnal equinox, and \\(\\delta\\) is \\(\\pm 23.5^{\\circ}\\) (minimum / maximum) for the winter and summer solstices.\nInserting \\(\\gamma\\) into formula Equation 1 returns declinations of \\(\\delta = -23.1^{\\circ}\\) on January 1, \\(0.39^{\\circ}\\) on March 22, \\(23.5^{\\circ}\\) on June 21, and \\(-23.1^{\\circ}\\) on December 31, respectively.

For 08:00 on July 22nd, we must additionally take into account the daylight saving time (Pacific Daylight Saving Time, PDT), that is PDT = PST + 1, hence 08:00 PDT = 07:00 PST.

This is incorporated in the equation of time (see lecture 4, slide 12). The time offset between LMST and LAT, in minutes can be calculated using the formula given in Lecture 4, Slide 12:\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Delta T_{\\rm{LAT}} = \\textrm{LMST} - \\textrm{LAT}  = && 229.18 \\times (0.000075 \\\\ &&+ 0.001868 \\cos \\gamma\n                - 0.032077 \\sin \\gamma \\\\\n               &&- 0.014615 \\cos(2\\gamma) - 0.040849 \\sin(2 \\gamma)\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is again the fractional year in radians (see question 1) which is \\(\\gamma = 0.775\\) for February 15, and \\(\\gamma = 3.48\\) for July 22. The offset \\(\\Delta T_{\\rm{LAT}} = \\textrm{LMST} - \\textrm{LAT}\\) is -14.3 min for February 15 and -6.41 min for July 22. Hence, \\(\\rm{LAT} = \\rm{LMST} - \\Delta T_{\\rm{LAT}}\\), is 13:30 - (-14.3 min) = 13:44 for February 15 and 06:30 - (-6.41 min) = 6:36 for July 22.\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the solar altitude angle \\(\\beta\\) for the same location and those two times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solar altitude \\(\\beta\\) can then be calculated by \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\sin \\beta = \\sin \\phi \\sin \\delta + \\cos \\phi \\cos \\delta \\cos h\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] \\(\\phi\\) is the latitude (\\(50^{\\circ}72^{\\prime}\\)N for Port Hardy), \\(\\delta\\) is the declination (see above), and \\(h\\) is the hour angle: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nh = 15^{\\circ} (12 - \\textrm{LAT})\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] where LAT is the local apparent time (see above) in hours of the day, i.e. $h = 15^{} (12 - 13.44) = -21.6^{} $ for February 15, and \\(h = 15^{\\circ} (12 - 6.36) = +84.6^{\\circ}\\) for July 22.\nFor February 15: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\sin \\beta &=& \\sin (50.72^{\\circ}) \\sin (-12.8^{\\circ}) + \\cos (50.72^{\\circ})  \\cos (-12.8^{\\circ}) \\cos (-21.6^{\\circ}) \\\\ &=& 0.403 \\\\\n\\beta &=& 23.74^{\\circ}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nFor July, 22: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\sin \\beta &=& \\sin (50.72^{\\circ}) \\sin (20.39^{\\circ}) + \\cos (50.72^{\\circ})  \\cos (20.39^{\\circ}) \\cos (84.6^{\\circ}) \\\\&=& 0.325 \\\\\n\\beta &=& 18.99^{\\circ}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nPlease make sure you transform all degrees to radians if your calculator is set to radians.\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the extraterrestrial short-wave irradiance \\(SW_{Ex}\\) for the same location and those two times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extraterrestrial short-wave irradiance \\(SW_{Ex}\\) is related through the cosine law of illumination to the solar constant and the solar altitude \\(\\beta\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nSW_{Ex} = I_0  \\left( \\frac{R_{av}}{R} \\right)^2 \\sin \\beta\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\\]\n\\(I_0\\) is the solar constant (1366.5 W m\\(^{-2}\\)) and the term \\(\\left( \\frac{R_{av}}{R} \\right)^2\\) accounts for the non-circular orbit (changing distance over course of a year). \\(\\gamma\\) is the fractional year as defined above.\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\left( \\frac{R_{av}}{R} \\right)^2 &=& 1.00011 + 0.034221 \\cos(\\gamma) + 0.001280  \\sin(\\gamma) \\\\\n&& + 0.000719  \\cos(2 \\gamma) + 0.000077  \\sin( \\gamma)\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\\]\nThe term \\(\\left( \\frac{R_{av}}{R} \\right)^2\\) is 1.02 on February 15 (Earth closer to the Sun than in the yearly average) and 0.97 (Earth further away from the Sun than in the yearly average).\n\\(SW_{Ex}\\) = \\(1366.5 \\times 1.02 \\times \\sin(23.74^{\\circ})\\) = 562 W m\\(^{-2}\\) on February 15, 08:00 PST and \\(SW_{Ex}\\) = \\(1366 \\times 0.97 \\times \\sin(18.99^{\\circ})\\) = 431 W m\\(^{-2}\\). Again, make sure you transform the solar altitude to radians if your calculator is set to radians.",

Personally, I find R a bit harder to read/write, but it is still fairly straightforward once you get a handle on the syntax. One advantage R has over python, is that its a bit easier to install.

Stull (1988): ‘An introduction to boundary layer meteorology’\n\n\n\n\n\nPressure is a type of stress that can act on a fluid at rest. For an infinitesimally small fluid element, such as idealized as the cube sketched in Fig 2.16a, pressure acts equally in all directions. Isotropic is the name given to characteristics that are the same in all directions (see Figs 2.4 and 2.5). If we consider just one face of this cube, as in Fig. 2.16b, we see that the isotropic nature of pressure tends to counteract itself in all directions except in a direction normal to (perpendicular to) the surface of the cube. Forces acting normal to all faces of the cube tend to compress or expand the cube, thereby deforming it (Fig 2.l6c). Because pressure is not dependent on direction, we need just one number to describe it at any point in space and time. Thus, pressure is a scalar.",

Stull (1988): ‘An introduction to boundary layer meteorology’\n\n\n\n\n\nViscous stress exists when there are shearing motions in the fluid. The motion can be laminar or turbulent. When one portion of a fluid moves, the intermolecular forces tend to drag adjacent fluid molecules in the same direction. The strength of these intermolecular forces depend on the nature of the fluid: molasses has stronger forces than water, which in turn has stronger forces than air. A measure of these forces is the viscosity. The result of this stress is a deformation of the fluid\nReynolds stress exists only when the fluid is in turbulent motion. A turbulent eddy can mix air of different wind speeds into our cube of interest (Fig 2.l6d). When this different-speed air is incorporated into one face of the cube and not the opposite face, the cube deforms because of the velocity differences between those two faces",

This cascade process is terminated when the Reynolds number based on the smallest eddy scales becomes small enough (order of one) for the smallest eddies to become stable under the influence of viscosity. At the smallest eddy sizes, the cascade of energy is dissipated into heat by molecular viscosity. The largest scale eddies have lengths on the order of a kilometer or three. These eddies are of the scale of the depth of the planetary boundary layer, which is approximately the height of the base of fair weather convective clouds. These large eddies are responsible for transport of mass and energy. Of the wide and continuous range of scales in a turbulent flow, a few have special significance and are used to characterize the flow itself. L = integral length scale.

Peaks in the spectrum show which size eddies contribute the most to the TKE. The leftmost peak (100 h) corresponds to wind speed variations associated with the passage of fronts and weather systems. The next peak (24 h) shows the diurnal increase of wind speed during the day and decrease at night. The rightmost peak indicates the microscale eddies (10 s to 10 min). Within the rightmost peak we see that the largest eddies are usually the most intense. The smaller, high frequency, eddies are very weak, as previously discussed. Large-eddy motions can create eddy-size wind-shear regions, which can generate smaller eddies. Such a net transfer of turbulence energy from the larger to the smaller eddies is known as the energy cascade. There appears to be a distinct lack of wind-speed variation having time periods of about 30 min to 1 h. The lack of variation at the internediate time or space scales has been called the spectral gap. Motions to the left of the gap are said to be associated with the mean flow. Motions to the right constitute turbulence. The center of the gap is near the one-hour time period.",

Heat conduction is usually an effective mode of transfer in solids (e.g. transport of heat beneath the surface), less so in liquids, and least important in gases. In general, pure molecular conduction is negligible in atmospheric applications, except within the very thin laminar boundary layer. In the atmosphere, the parcels of air (or eddies) transport energy and mass from one location to another. The eddies may be set into turbulent motion by free or forced convection. Free convection is due to the parcel of air being at a different density than the surrounding fluid (e.g. the motion of water in a heated kettle, and a similar bubbling of air parcels occurs when the Earth’s surface is strongly heated by solar radiation). Forced (mechanical) convection – flow of air or water over obstacles. Depends on the roughness of the surface and the speed of the horizontal flow.",

This is called the no-slip boundary condition (which is also applicable at the interface of two fluids with widely different densities (e.g., air and water)). Let’s say you have two plates – bottom plate (fixed surface) – fluid (liquid or gas) – top plate and let’s say you exert some kind of force (i.e. move to the right) Fluid will be displaced – move as layers – friction between layers (viscosity is responsible for the frictional resistance between adjacent fluid layers) The resistance force per unit area is called the shearing stress, because it is associated with the shearing motion (variation of velocity) between the layers.

As a consequence there is is no transport of momentum, energy and mass except via advection.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some applications, the atmosphere needs to be modelled as a viscous flow.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor theoretical treatments, fluid flows are commonly divided into two broad categories, namely, inviscid and viscous flows. In an inviscid or ideal fluid the effects of viscosity are completely ignored, i.e., the fluid is assumed to have no viscosity, and the flow is considered to be nonturbulent. This works only far away from any solid boundaries and far away from any strong density gradients. In the free atmosphere (i.e. above the planetary boundary layer, in which the effect of the earth’s surface friction on the air motion is negligible) the flow is often treated as inviscid, and the viscous forces may be neglected for many purposes; the air is usually treated (dynamically) as an ideal fluid. Inviscid flows are smooth and orderly, and the adjacent fluid layers can easily slip past each other or against solid surfaces without any friction or drag. Consequently, there is no mixing and no transfer of momentum, heat, and mass across the moving layers. Such properties can only be transported along the streamlines through advection. The inviscid flow theory obviously results in some serious dilemmas and inconsistencies when applied anywhere close to solid surfaces or density interfaces.",

Macroscale diffusivity of turbulence is usually many orders of magnitude larger than the molecular diffusivity. Dissipative: The kinetic energy of turbulent motion is continuously dissipated (converted into internal energy or heat) by viscosity. Therefore, in order to maintain turbulent motion, the energy has to be supplied continuously. If no energy is supplied, turbulence decays rapidly. Multiple length scales: All turbulent flows are characterized by a wide range (depending on the Reynolds number) of scales or eddies.

Momentum, same as ‘Shear stress’ (stress that results from layers moving past each other) – in the surface layer of frictional influence generates this shearing force and transmits it downwards as a flux of momentum. Thus the gradients of climatic properties (T, water vapor, [CO2], u, etc.) are very steep in the LBL, and since both the flux and the diffusivity are constant with height the vertical profile of a property is approximately linear, i.e. the gradient is constant.",

View factor (or shape factor) is a purely geometrical parameter that accounts for the effects of orientation on radiation between surfaces. The view factor ranges between zero and one. The SVF is a measure of how much sky is visible at a given location and can be used to easily describe the 3-dimensional form of the built environment as a 2-dimensional metric. Due to the fact that only a smaller part of the sky is seen from the surface (because of the horizontal and vertical unevenness of the surface elements), the outgoing long-wave radiation loss here is more restricted than in rural areas. Therefore, theoretically it is considered to be one of the major agents of the UHI phenomenon. The UHI intensity (∆T) for a given urban location is defined as the difference between the air or surface temperatures of that urban site and those of a carefully selected nearby non-urban (reference) site or those of a mean of non-urban sites",

The strong absorption bands at 1.45 and 1.95 μm are due to water. On the other hand, in the near infrared (NIR) high reflectivity enables the leaf to reject the bulk of the incident energy. The heat content of this radiation is very high but it is not useful for photosynthesis, therefore its rejection is helpful in offsetting the heat load on the leaf.\nThe high emissivity at longer wavelengths also helps the leaf to shed heat to the environment and keep leaf temperatures moderate. The cellular structure tends to cause almost totally diffuse scattering. This results in almost = portions of the radiation being reflected back & transmitted on through the leaf and explains why the αλ and ψλ curves in Figure 2 are similar in shape",

The diurnal variation of the albedo is much less with cloudy skies.\nIts role in explaining seasonal variations of albedo is obscured by changes in plant phenology, snow, etc. However, since the highest albedos occur at the times of low energy input the effect of this diurnal variation on the total radiation budget is small. This dependence upon the solar altitude also explains why tropical albedos are usually less than those for similar surfaces at higher latitudes, and accounts for the observation that the diurnal variation of the albedo is much less with cloudy skies.\nThis-pair-share: to get a robust estimate of α, students can either take the value at noon, the median value of the entire day, or do an average for a subset around midday. Also acceptable is the use of the daily totals or sums, i.e. α = sumK ↑ /sumK ↓.",

The surface warms up during the daytime, while it cools during the evening and night hours. Sensible (direct) heat flux - arises as a result of the difference in the temperatures of the surface and the air above. &gt; few millimeters (the thickness of the molecular sublayer), the primary mode of heat exchange becomes advection or convection involving air motions. Thus, the heat flux is down the average temperature gradient. latent heat or water vapor flux is a result of evaporation, evapotranspiration, or condensation at the surface. Nevertheless, evaporation results in some cooling of the surface, which in the surface energy budget is represented by the latent heat flux from the surface to the air above. heat exchange through the ground medium is primarily due to conduction if the medium is soil, rock, or concrete. Through water, however, heat is transferred first by conduction in the top few millimeters (molecular sublayer) from the surface and then by advection or convection in the deeper layers (surface layer, mixed layer, etc.) of water in motion. The depth of the submedium, which responds to and is affected by changes in the energy fluxes at the surface on a diurnal basis, is typically less than a meter for land surfaces and several tens of meters for lakes and oceans.\nThis equation describes how the net radiation at the surface must be balanced by a combination of the sensible and latent heat fluxes to the air and the heat flux to the subsurface medium.",

Their magnitudes are generally much smaller than the magnitudes of the daytime fluxes, except for QG. The magnitudes of QG do not differ widely between day and night, although the direction or sign obviously reverses.

The latent heat flux becomes an important or even dominant component of the surface energy balance, while the sensible heat flux to air is considerably reduced. The latter may even become negative during early periods of irrigation, particularly for small areas, due to advective effects. This is called the ‘oasis effect’ because it is similar to that of warm dry air blowing over a cool moist oasis. There is strong evaporation from the moist surface, resulting in cooling of the surface (due to latent heat transfer). The surface cooling causes a downward sensible heat flux from the warm air to the cool ground. Thus, QE is positive, while QH becomes negative, although much smaller in magnitude.",

    "text": "CA DBB Flux Station\nIn this lab, assignment, you’re going to look at data from the CA-DBB (aka “BB”) Eddy Covariance (EC) Station located in Delta, BC. On the assignment data page you can find a Climate_Summary_BB.csv with data from the CA-DBB station along with two metadata files, one describing the climate data and another describing the station. Reviewing the metadata is an important first step of any project.\n\nFigure 1 shows some pictures of the site from different perspectives. Figure 2 shows an interactive web map with high resolution satellite imagery. Clicking on “BB” in will zoom to the CA-DBB station and show the site’s “Flux Footprint Climatology”, which is a concept we’ll cover later in term. For now, we’ll stick to looking at some basic components of the site’s energy balance. Clicking the “BB” button again will toggle the footprint later on and off. You can pan/zoom to get a feel for what the site looks like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Looking south from above the in winter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Looking south from the EC station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Just after a fresh snowfall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Looking east from the top of the station in late summer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Location of UBC-Micromet Eddy Covariance Stations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Enter your information below\nStudent.Name = 'June Skeeter'\nStudent.Number = 123456789\nsprintf('GEOS 300 Assignment Submission for %s: %s',Student.Name,Student.Number)\n\n\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\")\nlibrary(\"reshape2\")\nlibrary(\"latex2exp\")\nlibrary(\"patchwork\")\nlibrary(\"tidyr\")\nlibrary(\"knitr\")\nlibrary(\"plyr\")\nlibrary(\"lubridate\")\nlibrary(\"zoo\")\nlibrary(\"readr\")\n\n\nQuestion 1\nBelow is an example showing the first few rows of the BB climate summary data.

Using the equations from lecture, calculate the Local Apparent Time (LAT), solar declination \\(\\delta\\), solar zenith angle \\(Z\\), and extraterrestrial irradiance \\(I_{ex}\\) for the center point of this observation period (12:45). Given the value of \\(I_{ex}\\), compared to observed \\(SW_\\downarrow\\), what is the approximate bulk transmissivity (\\(\\Psi_a\\)) coefficient of the atmosphere over CA-DBB at this point in time? Given the value of \\(I_{ex}\\), compared to observed \\(SW_\\downarrow\\), what is the approximate bulk transmissivity (\\(\\Psi_a\\)) coefficient of the atmosphere over CA-DBB at this point in time?\nNote: you can find the site’s Lat/Lon and time zone info in the CA-DBB station metadata file.\n\nQuestion 6\nNow calculate \\(\\Psi_a\\) for 12:45 January 19; the observed value of \\(SW_\\downarrow\\) was between 12:30 and 13:00 was 58.375 W\\(^m{-2}\\). What explains the difference between these two days?\n\n\nQuestion 7\nUsing the examples above as a template, calculate \\(R_n\\) over the cold-snap. Make a scatter plot showing \\(R_n\\) on the y-axis and \\(SW_\\downarrow\\) on the x-axis. Describe the relationship you.\n\n\nQuestion 8\nUsing the examples above as a template, create a new selection to see how typical summertime conditions compare to severe winter time conditions. Change the selection period so that it spans July 12th to July 19th, 2023. Provide summary statistics of the same variables as those shown above and produce plots like the ones shown above as well. Discuss how each of these variables during this mid-summer period compare to those from the cold-snap period.\n\n\nQuestion 9\nFind the timestamp of the observation interval when maximum \\(SW_\\downarrow\\) was observed for the mid-summer period. You will use observations from this timestamp to answer each of the questions below. Note our sites do not use daylight savings, so the UTC offset is fixed all year. Use this information to calculate \\(I_{ex}\\) and \\(\\Psi_a\\) for the mid-point of this observation period. Discus how these two values compare between this observation, and the observation spanning between 12:30 and 13:00 on January 13th of 2024. How does the magnitude differ and why does the relative timing of the maximum daily \\(SW_\\downarrow\\) differ?\n\n\nQuestion 10\nApproximately 42% of the energy in the short-wave is within the PAR band (Photosynthetically active radiation that can be used by plants to perform photosynthesis). Based on this assumption, calculate the energy available to plants (also called: photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD) at noon in \\(\\mu \\rm{mol}\\, \\rm{m}^{-2}\\,\\rm{s}^{-1}\\). You can use the wavelength of yellow light (\\(\\lambda 0.55 \\mu m\\)) for your estimate. Hint: Consult examples in reading package for radiation geometry.\n\n\nQuestion 11\nLet’s assume the surface emissivity at CA-DBB is \\(\\epsilon = 0.95\\). Using this assumption and the Stephan Boltzman law for grey bodies, estimate temperature of the land surface at CA-DBB for the time period identified above in question 9.\n\n\nQuestion 12\nNow use the same equation to estimate the “apparent” radiative sky temperature (\\(T_k\\)) from \\(LW_{\\downarrow}\\) for this timestamp. “Apparent” means you should assume \\(\\epsilon{a} = 1.0\\). How would you interpret \\(T_k\\)?\n\n\nQuestion 13\nUsing measured \\(LW_{\\downarrow}\\) and measured air temperature \\(T_a\\), calculate the actual bulk emissivity of the atmosphere \\(\\varepsilon_{a}\\) at noon? [2]\n\n\nQuestion 14\nUsing the Prata (1996) equation from lecture and measured \\(T_a\\) and \\(RH\\), what is the calculated apparent emissivity of the atmosphere and the calculated estimate of \\(LW_{\\downarrow}\\)? How well do these approximations match with what we actually observed?",

Specifically the UBC Vancouver campus is on xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) land.\n\nThere are nearly 200 First Nations spread through BC, and many more across the continent.\n\nIt is essential to recognize Indigenous territories and Indigenous sovereignty, especially within the context of geography courses.\nTo learn more about the Indigenous people, culture, and languages where you live and around the world, check out native-land.ca.\n\n\n\n\n\nMap Source\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Do an Acknowledgement?\nA land acknowledgement is meant to convey a deep rooted cultural connection to the land and the historical and present day injustices and violence enacted on Indigenous communities through colonialism. For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe. In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada. There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous culture and identity which as marginalized these communities in Canadian Society.\n\nAn acknowledgement is one small way to help with that, but it cannot be treated as a formality. It is a time to reflect and build understanding.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\n\nTraditional and Ancestral Recognize by whom the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied and the cultures have been handed down from generation to generation. The area around UBC was used by many different people, including the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm, əl̓ilwətaɁɬ, and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Nations. The map to the left shows the overlapping territories of these nations, along with others in the region.\nThese people are are part of a broader linguistic / cultural group of Coast Salish speaking people. The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm and əl̓ilwətaɁɬ speak dialects of Hul’q’umi’num’ / Halq’eméylem / hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ and the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh speak Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnceded: Refers to land that was not turned over to the government by a treaty or other agreement. Over 95% of the land in BC, and many lands elsewhere in the world were never ceded by treaty. Without treaties, these lands remain the sovereign territory of the First Nations that call them home. Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty. This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were “ceded” by treaty. Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation. The RCMP was created specifically to force indigenous people off their lands by any means necessary.",

My undergraduate thesis research investigated the impacts of fire on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes (CO2, CH4, and N2O) within different burned zones of a bog. The methodology incorporated chamber measurements and gas chromatography for the analysis. Currently, as a second-year MSc student, I am examining the impacts of seedling removal — a post-fire management practice — on the GHG fluxes (CO2 and CH4) within the 2016 burned zone of the Burns Bog, Delta, BC. This research utilizes a smart chamber with a portable analyzer. Additionally, I am interested in quantifying the net carbon exchange at the ecosystem scale using eddy covariance techniques and understanding carbon dynamics across varying ecosystem types.",

Radiation can be described as a form of energy due to the rapid oscillations of electromagnetic fields. The oscillations may be considered as travelling waves characterized by their wavelength λ (distance between successive wavecrests). Radiation is able to travel in a vacuum, and all radiation moves at the speed of light (c=3×108 ms−1), and in a straight path. Hence, instead of wavelength, we can express radiation by its frequency ν (in oscillations per second, i.e. s−1) (v = c/λ) We’re typically concerned with 0.1 to 100 μm with visible from 0.4 to 0.7 μm Particle properties. Radiation can be also described by discrete bundles of energy that have properties similar to particles. Quantum physics tells us that radiation is transferred as discrete packets called quanta (or photons if in the visible part of the spectrum). Energy of quantum is e = h ν. (h = Plancks constant (6.63 × 10-34 J s)) Plants can only use photons in the visible range of the spectrum which is also called photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 0.4 - 0.7 μm).",

Fourth, one approach uses measurements with all their associated errors. Can get Sky emissivity from temperature and LWin",

The effects diminish with distance away from the interface down into the substrate. The surface energy balance causes a temperature wave that establishes a temperature gradient ∂T/∂z and a sensible heat flux QG directed downwards by day and upwards at night. The size of both, ∂T/∂z and QG, diminish with distance away from the interface giving a changing vertical distribution (profile) of substrate temperatures Soil temperatures vary less rapidly than air temperatures, and since radiative and convective exchanges are virtually absent in the soil, most of the activity takes place from molecule to molecule.",

Soils with high diffusivities allow rapid penetration of surface temperature changes and permit these effects to involve a thick layer. For the same heat input the temperature regimes of soils with high diffusivity are less extreme than for soils with low diffusivities. By day the surface heating is used to warm a thick layer of soil, and at night the surface cooling can be partially offset by drawing upon heat from a similarly thick stratum. Soils with poor diffusivities concentrate their thermal exchanges only in the upper-most layer, and consequently experience relatively extreme diurnal temperature fluctuations. Therefore, in general a wet clay has a conservative thermal climate, whereas an almost dry peat is extreme.",

The introduction of even a thin snow cover over the landscape has dramatic effects. In a matter of a few hours a natural landscape can experience a change in albedo from approximately 0.25 to perhaps 0.80. Thereafter α declines as the snow pack ages (becomes compacted, and soiled), but with a fresh snow-fall it rapidly increases again. The wavelength dependence of the albedo of snow helps to explain the ease with which human skin becomes sunburnt, especially on sunny days on snow covered mountains.\nHuman skin is very sensitive to ultra-violet (UV) radiation, with peak sensitivity at about 0.3 \\(\\mu m\\). The potential for sunburn stretches from 0.295 to 0.330 \\(\\mu m\\). The lower limit is governed by the almost total absorption of these wavelengths by ozone in the high atmosphere (Reading Package Lectures 3-4, Figure 5, Panel b). With a fresh snow cover the receipt of potentially burning ultra-violet radiation by exposed skin is almost doubled, because in addition to that received from the incoming beam there is a very significant proportion received after surface reflection (due to the high value of αλ at these short wavelengths). The upward flux is responsible for sunburn on earlobes, throat and within nostrils, areas which are sensitive and normally in shade.",

For example, measurements of reflected shortwave from an instrument mounted above the surface include both surface and sub-surface reflection. The albedo calculated from such measurements is therefore a volume not a surface value. LW: However, although their emissivity ε is high the absolute magnitude of L↑ is usually relatively small because the surface temperature T0 is low. Since clouds are also close to being full radiators the net longwave exchange (L∗) between a fresh snowpack and a complete overcast is simply a function of their respective temperatures. Should the cloudbase be warmer than the snow surface there will actually be a positive L∗ budget at the snow surface. With clear skies L∗ is almost always negative, as is true of most other surfaces. Net allwave radiation. In general it may be said that the daytime net radiation surplus (Q∗) of snow and ice is small by comparison with most other natural surfaces. This is directly attributable to the high surface albedo. In the case of the Antarctic early summer budget shown in Figure 1 the surface albedo is 0.80. This results in so little shortwave radiation absorption that when it is combined with a net longwave loss, that is quite similar to other environments, the midday net all-wave radiation is less than 10% of the incoming solar radiation K↓.

A wet snowpack during the melt period the surface temperature will be held very close to 0◦C but the air temperature may be above freezing. Precipitation may then be as rain and the energy balance (Figure 2b) becomes: Here\\(H_r\\) heat supplied by rain if its temperature is greater than that of the snow. In some mid-latitude locations\\(H_r\\) can be a significant energy source for melt, especially where the area is open to storms originating over warm oceans. During active melting both radiation (Q∗) and convection (QH + LE) act as energy sources (Figure 2b) to support the change of phase (ice to water). The temperature of the snow changes very little in this process; therefore the large change of energy storage is due to latent rather than sensible heat uptake, i.e. ∆QM (latent heat storage change) rather than ∆QS.\nThe role of LE in the case of ‘wet’ snow is interesting. The surface vapour pressure of a melting ice or snow surface is of course the saturation value (e∗) at 0◦C which equals 611 Pa (See Oke, 1987, Table A3.2, p. 394). In absolute terms this is a low value and it is very common to find the warmer air above the surface has a greater vapour pressure. In that case an air-to- surface vapour pressure gradient exists, so that any turbulence contributes a downwards flux of moisture, and condensation on the surface. Since at 0◦C the latent heat of vaporization (Lv) released upon condensation is 7.5 times larger than the latent heat of fusion (Lf ) required for melting water, for every 1 g of water condensed sufficient energy is supplied to melt a further 7.5 g. Under these conditions LE is an important energy source. Of course should the air be drier than 611 Pa the vapour gradient would be the reverse, evaporation would occur",

This is because the air-mass was slightly warmer than the snow surface. Prior to noon the heat input to the pack is almost entirely put into storage, ∆QS. This is used to raise the snow temperature from its overnight value to the freezing point and then to change the proportions of ice and water in the pack. The melt peaks in the afternoon period and then declines as the pack cools again. The decline is retarded somewhat by the release of latent heat of fusion (Lf ) as the upper layers re-freeze.\nIn Figure 3 heat conduction into the soil is not large enough to warrant inclusion.",

The energy balances of the major oceans are then as given in Table 3.1 which strikingly illustrates the dominant role played by evaporation (LE ) as an energy sink for a water body.

Wind shear is the change in wind direction and/or wind speed over a specific horizontal or vertical distance. When the change in wind speed and direction is pronounced, quite severe turbulence can be expected. Shear Produces Turbulence: Turbulence is an instability generated by shear. The stronger the shear, the stronger the turbulence.\nThe maximum turbulence level occurs at the positions of maximum shear. The shear in the boundary layer decreases moving away from the bed, and as a result the turbulence intensity also decreases.",

At the smallest eddy sizes, the cascade of energy is dissipated into heat by molecular viscosity. Turbulent kinetic energy is one of the most important variables in micrometeorology.

Mechanical turbulence production requires continual supply of kinetic energy (mean wind) while thermal turbulence requires continual supply of a sensible heat flux (surface heating).

Stull (1988)\n\n\n\n:::\n::::\n\nWe would like to be able to take snapshots of the eddies in three dimensions and measure all their sizes each instant. Unfortunately, we do not have a good way to do this. Instead, we can simply measure the fluctuations of a variable such as wind speed, specific humidity, or temperature with a sensor at one location for a period of time. In this way, we watch the eddies drift by the sensor. But the eddies could be changing size and shape as they drift by the sensor. Let’s put this physical concept in the context of the total derivative.\nTake a variable like temperature, T. We know that the change in T with time at any location (such as where a sensor might be placed) is the sum of the total derivative and the temperature advection: The temperature advection is the change in temperature at the sensor due to the advection of warmer or colder air past the sensor. The total derivative is the change in temperature of an air parcel moving past the sensor. Such a temperature change may be caused by any number of processes, such as the absorption or emission of radiation, condensation or evaporation (latent heating or cooling), or compression and expansion. Taylor’s hypothesis says that we can assume that the turbulent eddies (which we can think of as large air parcels) are frozen as they advect past the sensor and thus the change in temperature within each eddy is negligible: The temperature advection is the change in temperature at the sensor due to the advection of warmer or colder air past the sensor. The total derivative is the change in temperature of an air parcel moving past the sensor.

While the thermal properties of the soils that you estimated in the previous question have not changed. You can assume that \\(R_n\\), \\(LE\\), and \\(Ta_{0.1}\\) remain fixed at their initial values, but \\(T_0\\) and \\(Ts_{0.1}\\) will change. It begins to snow heavily for 6 hours, and at the end of the snow-storm all three sites have experienced some amount of snow accumulation. Assuming that no snow accumulated at each site until \\(T_0 &lt; 0 ^{\\circ}C\\) which site do you expect would have the most snow, and which would have the least snow at the end of the snow storm? Explain your reasoning. Note you are not expected to specify how much snow accumulation will occur, just rank the sites in relative terms. 1/3\n\n\n\\(R_n\\) and \\(LE\\) are zero. From the temperature gradients, we can assume \\(H\\) will be positive slightly positive (soil surface losing heat to atmosphere) and \\(H_g\\) will be negative soil at depth losing heat to soil surface. However, we can’t assume that \\(0 = H+H_G\\) (same magnitude/opposite sign) in this case, because we have to account for another component of the energy balance, \\(\\Delta M\\), that we did not have to think about in previously.\n\nGiven the outlined assumption (snow won’t accumulate until \\(T_0 &lt; 0 ^{\\circ} C\\)) the first soil to have \\(T_0\\) &lt; 0 will accumulate snow first. Until then, snow will melt on the grounds surface until \\(T_0 &lt; 0 ^{\\circ} C\\). The process of melting will remove heat from the soil as well \\(\\Delta M &gt;0\\); which means \\(0 = H + H_G + \\Delta_M\\).\n\nSnowfall accumulation is expected to be inversely related to to thermal admittance \\(\\mu\\) because lower thermal admittance means surface cools rapidly (less heat transfer from depth).\n\nThermal admittance does increase as a function of \\(\\Theta_w\\), and the water input from melting will increase \\(\\mu\\) slightly.

While the thermal properties of the soils that you estimated in the previous question have not changed. You can assume that \\(R_n\\), \\(LE\\), and \\(Ta_{0.1}\\) remain fixed at their initial values, but \\(T_0\\) and \\(Ts_{0.1}\\) will change. It begins to snow heavily for 6 hours, and at the end of the snow-storm all three sites have experienced some amount of snow accumulation. Assuming that no snow accumulated at each site until \\(T_0 &lt; 0 ^{\\circ}C\\) which site do you expect would have the most snow, and which would have the least snow at the end of the snow storm? Explain your reasoning. Note you are not expected to specify how much snow accumulation will occur, just rank the sites in relative terms. 1/3\n\n\n\\(R_n\\) and \\(LE\\) are zero. From the temperature gradients, we can assume \\(H\\) will be positive slightly positive (soil surface losing heat to atmosphere) and \\(H_g\\) will be negative soil at depth losing heat to soil surface. However, we can’t assume that \\(0 = H+H_G\\) (same magnitude/opposite sign) in this case, because we have to account for another component of the energy balance, \\(\\Delta M\\), that we did not have to think about in previously.\n\nGiven the outlined assumption (snow won’t accumulate until \\(T_0 &lt; 0 ^{\\circ} C\\)) the first soil to have \\(T_0\\) &lt; 0 will accumulate snow first. Until then, snow will melt on the grounds surface until \\(T_0 &lt; 0 ^{\\circ} C\\). The process of melting will remove heat from the soil as well \\(\\Delta M &gt;0\\); which means \\(0 = H + H_G + \\Delta_M\\).\n\nSnowfall accumulation is expected to be inversely related to to thermal admittance \\(\\mu\\) because lower thermal admittance means surface cools rapidly (less heat transfer from depth).\n\nThermal admittance does increase as a function of \\(\\Theta_w\\), and the water input from melting will increase \\(\\mu\\) slightly. While the increase is not linear, since all soils have initial \\(\\Theta_w &gt; 0.15\\), its close enough to linear that one could reasonably assume a linear relationship.
