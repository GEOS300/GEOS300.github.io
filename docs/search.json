    "text": "Calculate Earth’s declination \\(\\delta\\) for the following dates: January 1, March 22, June 21, and December 31.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\delta = & 0.006918 - 0.399912 \\cos( \\gamma)+0.070257 \\sin( \\gamma)  \\\\\n         & -0.006758 \\cos(2 \\gamma) + 0.000907\\sin(2\\gamma) \\nonumber \\\\\n         & -0.002697\\cos(3\\gamma)+0.00148 \\sin(3\\gamma) \\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is the fractional year and DOY is the day of the year:\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{2 \\pi }{365} (DOY-1)\n\\tag{2}\\]\n\\(\\rm{DOY}\\) is the number of the day of the year, which is 1 (January 1), 81 (March 22), 172 (June 21), and 365 (December 31) - assuming a non-leap year. Gamma is 0.00 (January 1), 1.38 (March 22), 2.94 (June 21), and 6.27 (December 31).\nDeclination changes throughout the year, but for a given date it is the same for the whole planet. \\(\\delta\\) is \\(0^{\\circ}\\) during the vernal and autumnal equinox, and \\(\\delta\\) is \\(\\pm 23.5^{\\circ}\\) (minimum / maximum) for the winter and summer solstices.\nInserting \\(\\gamma\\) into formula Equation 1 returns declinations of \\(\\delta = -23.1^{\\circ}\\) on January 1, \\(0.39^{\\circ}\\) on March 22, \\(23.5^{\\circ}\\) on June 21, and \\(-23.1^{\\circ}\\) on December 31, respectively. Note that formula Equation 1 returns \\(\\delta\\) in radians, so you have to multiply the result form Eq. by \\(\\frac{360}{2 \\pi}\\) to get degrees.\nInserting \\(\\emph{DOY}\\) into formula (Equation 2) returns declinations of \\(\\delta = -23.0^{\\circ}\\) on January 1, \\(-0.1^{\\circ}\\) on March 22, \\(23.4^{\\circ}\\) on June 21, and \\(-23.1^{\\circ}\\) on December 31, respectively, which is slightly different from the calculation above. This is because formula (\\(\\ref{E3}\\)) is . It assumes a circular orbit of Earth around the Sun.\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the Local Mean Solar Time (LMST) for Port Hardy, BC on Vancouver Island, if a regular 24h clock shows 14:00 on February 15th, and 08:00 on July 22nd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal mean solar time (LMST) is the geometric adjustment for the east-west location within the time zone (see Lecture 4 or reading package) to make sure that the sun path reaches it’s highest point at noon.\nPort Hardy’s longitude is \\(127^{\\circ}30^{\\prime}\\)W. It is located within the Pacific Standard Time Zone (PST) - similar to Vancouver - whose standard meridian is at \\(120^{\\circ}\\textrm{W} (=8 \\times 15^{\\circ})\\). The offset between PST and LMST is, in minutes:\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\textrm{PST} - \\textrm{LST} = 4\\,\\textrm{min}/^{\\circ} \\times (120-127.5) = -30  \\textrm{min}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\]\nAt 14:00 on February 15th, we do have a LMST of 13:30. For 08:00 on July 22nd, we must additionally take into account the daylight saving time (Pacific Daylight Saving Time, PDT), that is PDT = PST + 1, hence 08:00 PDT = 07:00 PST. Again, subtract the 30 minutes, and we get a LMST of 06:30 for 08:00 on July 22nd.\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the Local Apparent Time (LAT) for the same location and times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe local apparent time, does - in addition to the above geometric adjustment for longitude - also take into account the effects the non-circular orbit and the fact that Earth’s rotational speed changes over a year. This is incorporated in the equation of time (see lecture 4, slide 12). The time offset between LMST and LAT, in minutes can be calculated using the formula given in Lecture 4, Slide 12:\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Delta T_{\\rm{LAT}} = \\textrm{LMST} - \\textrm{LAT}  = && 229.18 \\times (0.000075 \\\\ &&+ 0.001868 \\cos \\gamma\n                - 0.032077 \\sin \\gamma \\\\\n               &&- 0.014615 \\cos(2\\gamma) - 0.040849 \\sin(2 \\gamma)\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is again the fractional year in radians (see question 1) which is \\(\\gamma = 0.775\\) for February 15, and \\(\\gamma = 3.48\\) for July 22. The offset \\(\\Delta T_{\\rm{LAT}} = \\textrm{LMST} - \\textrm{LAT}\\) is -14.3 min for February 15 and -6.41 min for July 22. Hence, \\(\\rm{LAT} = \\rm{LMST} - \\Delta T_{\\rm{LAT}}\\), is 13:30 - (-14.3 min) = 13:44 for February 15 and 06:30 - (-6.41 min) = 6:36 for July 22.\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the solar altitude angle \\(\\beta\\) for the same location and those two times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solar altitude \\(\\beta\\) can then be calculated by \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\sin \\beta = \\sin \\phi \\sin \\delta + \\cos \\phi \\cos \\delta \\cos h\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] \\(\\phi\\) is the latitude (\\(50^{\\circ}72^{\\prime}\\)N for Port Hardy), \\(\\delta\\) is the declination (see above), and \\(h\\) is the hour angle: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nh = 15^{\\circ} (12 - \\textrm{LAT})\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\] where LAT is the local apparent time (see above) in hours of the day, i.e. $h = 15^{} (12 - 13.44) = -21.6^{} $ for February 15, and \\(h = 15^{\\circ} (12 - 6.36) = +84.6^{\\circ}\\) for July 22.\nFor February 15: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\sin \\beta &=& \\sin (50.72^{\\circ}) \\sin (-12.8^{\\circ}) + \\cos (50.72^{\\circ})  \\cos (-12.8^{\\circ}) \\cos (-21.6^{\\circ}) \\\\ &=& 0.403 \\\\\n\\beta &=& 23.74^{\\circ}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nFor July, 22: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\sin \\beta &=& \\sin (50.72^{\\circ}) \\sin (20.39^{\\circ}) + \\cos (50.72^{\\circ})  \\cos (20.39^{\\circ}) \\cos (84.6^{\\circ}) \\\\&=& 0.325 \\\\\n\\beta &=& 18.99^{\\circ}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nPlease make sure you transform all degrees to radians if your calculator is set to radians.\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the extraterrestrial short-wave irradiance \\(SW_{Ex}\\) for the same location and those two times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extraterrestrial short-wave irradiance \\(SW_{Ex}\\) is related through the cosine law of illumination to the solar constant and the solar altitude \\(\\beta\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nSW_{Ex} = I_0  \\left( \\frac{R_{av}}{R} \\right)^2 \\sin \\beta\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\\]\n\\(I_0\\) is the solar constant (1366.5 W m\\(^{-2}\\)) and the term \\(\\left( \\frac{R_{av}}{R} \\right)^2\\) accounts for the non-circular orbit (changing distance over course of a year). \\(\\gamma\\) is the fractional year as defined above.\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\left( \\frac{R_{av}}{R} \\right)^2 &=& 1.00011 + 0.034221 \\cos(\\gamma) + 0.001280  \\sin(\\gamma) \\\\\n&& + 0.000719  \\cos(2 \\gamma) + 0.000077  \\sin( \\gamma)\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\\]\nThe term \\(\\left( \\frac{R_{av}}{R} \\right)^2\\) is 1.02 on February 15 (Earth closer to the Sun than in the yearly average) and 0.97 (Earth further away from the Sun than in the yearly average).\n\\(SW_{Ex}\\) = \\(1366.5 \\times 1.02 \\times \\sin(23.74^{\\circ})\\) = 562 W m\\(^{-2}\\) on February 15, 08:00 PST and \\(SW_{Ex}\\) = \\(1366 \\times 0.97 \\times \\sin(18.99^{\\circ})\\) = 431 W m\\(^{-2}\\). Again, make sure you transform the solar altitude to radians if your calculator is set to radians.",

Personally, I find R a bit harder to read/write, but it is still fairly straightforward once you get a handle on the syntax. One advantage R has over python, is that its a bit easier to install.

The effects diminish with distance away from the interface down into the substrate. The surface energy balance causes a temperature wave that establishes a temperature gradient ∂T/∂z and a sensible heat flux QG directed downwards by day and upwards at night. The size of both, ∂T/∂z and QG, diminish with distance away from the interface giving a changing vertical distribution (profile) of substrate temperatures Soil temperatures vary less rapidly than air temperatures, and since radiative and convective exchanges are virtually absent in the soil, most of the activity takes place from molecule to molecule.",

Soils with high diffusivities allow rapid penetration of surface temperature changes and permit these effects to involve a thick layer. For the same heat input the temperature regimes of soils with high diffusivity are less extreme than for soils with low diffusivities. By day the surface heating is used to warm a thick layer of soil, and at night the surface cooling can be partially offset by drawing upon heat from a similarly thick stratum. Soils with poor diffusivities concentrate their thermal exchanges only in the upper-most layer, and consequently experience relatively extreme diurnal temperature fluctuations. Therefore, in general a wet clay has a conservative thermal climate, whereas an almost dry peat is extreme.",

They radiate like blackbodies (e ^ 1) at their respective cloud base temperatures. In passing through the atmosphere, a large part of the terrestrial radiation is absorbed by atmospheric gases, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, methane, and ozone. In particular, water vapor and CO2 are primarily responsible for absorbing the terrestrial radiation and reducing its escape to the space (the so-called greenhouse effect). The atmospheric gases and aerosols which absorb energy also radiate energy.",

Radiation can be described as a form of energy due to the rapid oscillations of electromagnetic fields. The oscillations may be considered as travelling waves characterized by their wavelength λ (distance between successive wavecrests). Radiation is able to travel in a vacuum, and all radiation moves at the speed of light (c=3×108 ms−1), and in a straight path. Hence, instead of wavelength, we can express radiation by its frequency ν (in oscillations per second, i.e. s−1) (v = c/λ) We’re typically concerned with 0.1 to 100 μm with visible from 0.4 to 0.7 μm Particle properties. Radiation can be also described by discrete bundles of energy that have properties similar to particles. Quantum physics tells us that radiation is transferred as discrete packets called quanta (or photons if in the visible part of the spectrum). Energy of quantum is e = h ν. (h = Plancks constant (6.63 × 10-34 J s)) Plants can only use photons in the visible range of the spectrum which is also called photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 0.4 - 0.7 μm).",

However, conduction is important to the transport of heat beneath the surface. As we’ll get to later in this course, conduction of heat is dependent on the thermal properties of the substrate.",

It can be free (self propagating) or forced (mechanically induced).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne.g. looking at boiling water In the atmosphere, the parcels of air (or eddies) transport energy and mass from one location to another. The eddies may be set into turbulent motion by free or forced convection. Free convection is due to the parcel of air being at a different density than the surrounding fluid (e.g. the motion of water in a heated kettle, and a similar bubbling of air parcels occurs when the Earth’s surface is strongly heated by solar radiation). Forced (mechanical) convection – flow of air or water over obstacles. Depends on the roughness of the surface and the speed of the horizontal flow.",

Specifically the UBC Vancouver campus is on xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) land.\n\nThere are nearly 200 First Nations spread through BC, and many more across the continent.\n\nIt is essential to recognize Indigenous territories and Indigenous sovereignty, especially within the context of geography courses.\nTo learn more about the Indigenous people, culture, and languages where you live and around the world, check out native-land.ca.\n\n\n\n\n\nMap Source\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Do an Acknowledgement?\nA land acknowledgement is meant to convey a deep rooted cultural connection to the land and the historical and present day injustices and violence enacted on Indigenous communities through colonialism. For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe. In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada. There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous culture and identity which as marginalized these communities in Canadian Society.\n\nAn acknowledgement is one small way to help with that, but it cannot be treated as a formality. It is a time to reflect and build understanding.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\n\nTraditional and Ancestral Recognize by whom the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied and the cultures have been handed down from generation to generation. The area around UBC was used by many different people, including the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm, əl̓ilwətaɁɬ, and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Nations. The map to the left shows the overlapping territories of these nations, along with others in the region.\nThese people are are part of a broader linguistic / cultural group of Coast Salish speaking people. The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm and əl̓ilwətaɁɬ speak dialects of Hul’q’umi’num’ / Halq’eméylem / hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ and the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh speak Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnceded: Refers to land that was not turned over to the government by a treaty or other agreement. Over 95% of the land in BC, and many lands elsewhere in the world were never ceded by treaty. Without treaties, these lands remain the sovereign territory of the First Nations that call them home. Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty. This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were “ceded” by treaty. Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation. The RCMP was created specifically to force indigenous people off their lands by any means necessary.",

Based on this assumption, calculate the energy available to plants (also called: photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD) at noon in \\(\\mu \\rm{mol}\\, \\rm{m}^{-2}\\,\\rm{s}^{-1}\\). You can use the wavelength of yellow light (\\(\\lambda 0 0.55 \\mu m\\)) for your estimate. Hint: Consult examples in reading package for radiation geometry.\n\n\nQuestion 11\nLet’s assume the surface emissivity at CA-DBB is \\(\\epsilon = 0.95\\). Using this assumption and the Stephan Boltzman law for grey bodies, estimate temperature of the land surface at CA-DBB for the time period identified above in question 9.\n\n\nQuestion 12\nNow use the same equation to estimate the “apparent” radiative sky temperature (\\(T_k\\)) from \\(LW_{\\downarrow}\\) for this timestamp. “Apparent” means you should assume \\(\\epsilon{a} = 1.0\\). How would you interpret \\(T_k\\)?\n\n\nQuestion 13\nUsing measured \\(LW_{\\downarrow}\\) and measured air temperature \\(T_a\\), calculate the actual bulk emissivity of the atmosphere \\(\\varepsilon_{a}\\) at noon? [2]\n\n\nQuestion 14\nUsing the Prata (1996) equation from lecture and measured \\(T_a\\) and \\(RH\\), what is the calculated apparent emissivity of the atmosphere and the calculated estimate of \\(LS_{\\downarrow}\\)? How well do these approximations match with what we actually observed?",

Daytime dominated by the solar radiation (toward the surface), at night the net radiation is much weaker & away from the surface. The surface warms up during the daytime, while it cools during the evening and night hours. Sensible (direct) heat flux - arises as a result of the difference in the temperatures of the surface and the air above. &gt; few millimeters (the thickness of the molecular sublayer), the primary mode of heat exchange becomes advection or convection involving air motions. Thus, the heat flux is down the average temperature gradient. latent heat or water vapor flux is a result of evaporation, evapotranspiration, or condensation at the surface. Nevertheless, evaporation results in some cooling of the surface, which in the surface energy budget is represented by the latent heat flux from the surface to the air above. heat exchange through the ground medium is primarily due to conduction if the medium is soil, rock, or concrete. Through water, however, heat is transferred first by conduction in the top few millimeters (molecular sublayer) from the surface and then by advection or convection in the deeper layers (surface layer, mixed layer, etc.) of water in motion. The depth of the submedium, which responds to and is affected by changes in the energy fluxes at the surface on a diurnal basis, is typically less than a meter for land surfaces and several tens of meters for lakes and oceans.\nThis equation describes how the net radiation at the surface must be balanced by a combination of the sensible and latent heat fluxes to the air and the heat flux to the subsurface medium.",

All the terms of the surface energy balance for land surfaces are usually negative during the evening and nighttime periods. Their magnitudes are generally much smaller than the magnitudes of the daytime fluxes, except for QG. The magnitudes of QG do not differ widely between day and night, although the direction or sign obviously reverses. One can interpret the EB equation in terms of the partitioning of net radiation into other fluxes. The net radiation may be considered an external forcing, while the sensible, latent and ground heat fluxes are responses to this radiative forcing.",

    "text": "Real world examples: Freshwater marsh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWetting of the subsurface soil by precipitation or artificial irrigation can dramatically alter the surface energy balance, as well as the microclimate near the surface. The latent heat flux becomes an important or even dominant component of the surface energy balance, while the sensible heat flux to air is considerably reduced. The latter may even become negative during early periods of irrigation, particularly for small areas, due to advective effects. This is called the ‘oasis effect’ because it is similar to that of warm dry air blowing over a cool moist oasis. There is strong evaporation from the moist surface, resulting in cooling of the surface (due to latent heat transfer). The surface cooling causes a downward sensible heat flux from the warm air to the cool ground. Thus, QE is positive, while QH becomes negative, although much smaller in magnitude.",

The strong absorption bands at 1.45 and 1.95 μm are due to water. On the other hand, in the near infrared (NIR) high reflectivity enables the leaf to reject the bulk of the incident energy. The heat content of this radiation is very high but it is not useful for photosynthesis, therefore its rejection is helpful in offsetting the heat load on the leaf.\nThe high emissivity at longer wavelengths also helps the leaf to shed heat to the environment and keep leaf temperatures moderate. The cellular structure tends to cause almost totally diffuse scattering. This results in almost = portions of the radiation being reflected back & transmitted on through the leaf and explains why the αλ and ψλ curves in Figure 2 are similar in shape",

In that year, heavy rain in the Northern Great Plains (North and South Dakota, Alberta, and Saskatchewan) led to flooding in the Missouri River. The resulting exceptionally lush vegetation appears as a positive anomaly (green). Concurrently, in the Eastern U.S., rainfall was very low, and the region exhibited a strong negative anomaly (dark red).",

The diurnal variation of the albedo is much less with cloudy skies.\nIts role in explaining seasonal variations of albedo is obscured by changes in plant phenology, snow, etc. However, since the highest albedos occur at the times of low energy input the effect of this diurnal variation on the total radiation budget is small. This dependence upon the solar altitude also explains why tropical albedos are usually less than those for similar surfaces at higher latitudes, and accounts for the observation that the diurnal variation of the albedo is much less with cloudy skies.\nThis-pair-share: to get a robust estimate of α, students can either take the value at noon, the median value of the entire day, or do an average for a subset around midday. Also acceptable is the use of the daily totals or sums, i.e. α = sumK ↑ /sumK ↓.",

View factor (or shape factor) is a purely geometrical parameter that accounts for the effects of orientation on radiation between surfaces. The view factor ranges between zero and one. The SVF is a measure of how much sky is visible at a given location and can be used to easily describe the 3-dimensional form of the built environment as a 2-dimensional metric. Due to the fact that only a smaller part of the sky is seen from the surface (because of the horizontal and vertical unevenness of the surface elements), the outgoing long-wave radiation loss here is more restricted than in rural areas. Therefore, theoretically it is considered to be one of the major agents of the UHI phenomenon. The UHI intensity (∆T) for a given urban location is defined as the difference between the air or surface temperatures of that urban site and those of a carefully selected nearby non-urban (reference) site or those of a mean of non-urban sites",

    "text": "Radiation Balance of a Layer of Air\n\n\n\nFor thin layers of air (&lt;50 m) during the day it is usually assumed that radiative flux divergence is negligible and can be ignored, e.g. we place a radiometer at any height in the surface layer and it gives a reasonable approximation of the surface value.\nUnder these conditions it is assumed that air temperature changes are solely due to sensible heat flux density changes with height.\n\nLatent heat flux density changes are important when fog is forming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental set-up to measure the radiative flux divergence at UBC Totem Field.\n\n\n\n\n\nConvection is the main transport process, but unless fog is actively forming (releasing latent heat) only QH is relevant for changing Ta. If inputs of sensible heat exceed losses for an air layer, warming takes place (turbulent flux convergence). If losses of sensible heat exceed gains then the layer cools (turbulent flux divergence).",
