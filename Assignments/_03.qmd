[Python and R code templates be found here](https://github.com/GEOS300/Assignment03) to help get you started.

In this exercise you will use a 30-min data-set measured above an extensively flat cotton field near [Kettleman City, CA, US](http://www.eol.ucar.edu/rtf/projects/ebex2000/). The actual day / time is selected based on your student number, the timestamp you are responsible for can be found in (@tbl-dates). You will be provided with two tables: 

**Wind**: lists horizontal wind speeds $\overline{u}$ measured with cup-anemometers installed at six heights on a profile tower averaged over 30 minutes. Screen-level air temperature is also provided.

**Turbulence**: contains longitudinal wind $u$, lateral wind $v$ and vertical wind $w$ measured every second over the same 30 minutes by a fast-response anemometer located at 6.4 m height.

* For all questions assume neutral conditions, $z_d=0$, and $P_a$ = 100 kPa.


Last digit of student number | date (YYYmmddHHMM)
-----------------------------|-----
0 | 200008021530
1 | 200008031000
2 | 200008031030
3 | 200008031200
4 | 200008041030
5 | 200008041100
6 | 200008041130
7 | 200008041530
8 | 200008101230
9 | 200008101530


: The Timestamp you are responsible for analyzing in YYYY (Year) mm (month) dd (day) HH (hour) MM (minute) format.  The filename for your date will follow this format: YYYYmmddHHMM.txt.  e.g., wind202402141330.txt and turbulence202402141330.txt would be the files for February 14th, 2023 13:30.  If you are completing the assignment using Python or R, just edit the filename timestamp in the corresponding template. If you are completing the assignment by hand or in excel, you can find the data files [here](https://github.com/GEOS300/AssignmentData/tree/main/WesthamIslandSoilData). {#tbl-dates}

## Question 1

Estimate $z_0$ graphically from all measured values of the wind profile in Table 1. You can either use a spreadsheet/software or by hand using [semi-logarithmic graph paper](https://www.eeweb.com/wp-content/uploads/semi-log-graph-paper.pdf). **Note**: If you solve this question using a semi-logarithmic paper, use a ruler and your graphical judgement (subjective) to create the best fit through the points.

## Question 2

Based on the slope of the curve in Question 1, calculate the friction velocity $u_{\ast}$.[4]

\item Estimate the surface shear stress $\tau_0$ from the result in Question 2 and with help of Appendix A3 (p. 392 ff.) in T. R. Oke, 'Boundary Layer Climates available on Canvas. [2]

\item Estimate the eddy diffusivities for momentum $K_M$ using the wind gradients $\Delta \overline{u}$ in Table 1 between (a) $z=0.95$ and $1.55$ m, (b) $z=1.55$ and $2.35$ m, (c) $z=2.35$ and $3.72$ m, (d) $z=3.72$ and $6.15$ m, and (e) $z=6.15$ and $9.05$ m. How does $K_M$  change with height? Explain why. [6]

\item From the values in Table 1, calculate the aerodynamic resistance of the momentum flux $r_{a_M}$ for the layer from the surface to 9.05 m. [2] 

\item From the turbulence data provided in Table 2, calculate $\overline{u}$, $\overline{v}$, and $\overline{w}$ $\dagger$ [4]

\item From the data in Table 2 calculate $\overline{u^{\prime 2}}$, $\overline{v^{\prime 2}}$, and $\overline{w^{\prime 2}}$. Name those parameters. [4].

\item From the data in Table 2 calculate the turbulence intensities $I_u$, $I_v$, and $I_w$. [2].

\item From the data in Table 2 calculate the mean turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass $\overline{e}$. What is the ratio of $\overline{e}$ to the mean kinetic energy per unit mass? [2].

\item Which of the three wind components, $u$, $v$ or $w$, contains most turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass. Speculate about the shape of the eddies [2].

\item From the data in Table 2 calculate (a) $\overline{u^{\prime}v^{\prime}}$ and (b) $\overline{u^{\prime}w^{\prime}}$ [4]

\item Calculate $r_{uv}$ and $r_{uw}$ $\dagger$. Discuss your results. [3]

\item Plot a scatter graph of $u^{\prime}$ ($x$-axis) vs. $w^{\prime}$ ($y$-axis). Comment your graph and discuss if it looks like you expected. $\dagger$ [6]

\item Using your result in question 11 (b), calculate the friction velocity $u_{\ast}$ based on the high-frequency data and compare it to your answer in question 2.  $\dagger$ [3].

To answer questions marked by a $\dagger$ it is highly recommended to use R (or other programming language) or Excel. See the course web-page for help documents on how to use the most common graph software (e.g. Excel) or R. If you still do not have access to a computer and/or appropriate software, you can use only values recorded at a full minute (i.e. every 60th value) of the high-frequency wind data to solve questions 6 to 12 and speculate about the impact this approach has on your calculations.
