@fig-BB1 shows some pictures of the site from different perspectives.  @fig-map shows an interactive web map with high resolution satellite imagery.  Clicking on "BB" in will zoom to the CA-DBB station and show the site's "Flux Footprint Climatology", which is the average "field of view" of the eddy covariance system at the station.  Clicking the "BB" button again will toggle the footprint later on and off.  You can pan/zoom to get a feel for what the site looks like.  Take note of the scale bar in the bottom left to get a sense for how large the footprint is.  @tbl-dates shows the estimated size of the source area contours.
