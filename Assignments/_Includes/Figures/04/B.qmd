# Extra Credit: Self guided field trip

**Note** the extra credit is due with the final exam.  Don't submit the extra credit with Assignment 4!  There will be a space to upload your extra credit on canvas in the exam!  The total value of the extra credit is yet to be determined, it will depend on how many people complete it and how much thought goes into the responses.

The CA-DBB eddy covariance station is located within the Burns Bog Ecological Conservancy Area.  It is a large peatland area that is being actively managed to restore the the ecosystem after decades of peat harvesting and mismanagement.  Public access to the bog is prohibited, so we can't take a field trip to visit the site.  However, you can visit a (much smaller) restored peatland, which is only 30 minutes away from UBC!  The [Camosun Bog](http://camosunbog.ca/restoration-methods/) is a restored remnant of a once much larger peat bog, located on the eastern edgy of Pacific Spirit Park.  The entrance to the bog is a 6 minute walks south along Camosun street from 16th avenue, and it can easily accessible from UBC by bus via the 25 or 33 bus @fig-Camosun-Map.  The bog has a short elevated boardwalk @fig-Camosun-Map2 path with informational signs @fig-Camosun-Sign that allows visitors to explore this unique urban-peatland without disturbing the fragile ecosystem.  The bog is centered on "Devils Hole" (@fig-Camosun-Pond), a restored pond area surrounded by a small open sphagnum peatland that grades into the surrounding forested landscape.

## Extra Credit Tasks!

1. Visit the Camosun Bog!  Go to the Camosun Bog, walk around the boardwalk area, read the interpretive signs, and check out the unique ecosystem.   Take a selfie from the bog (or group photo if you visit with classmates!) with the bog clearly visible in the background to verify your visit.  If you aren't comfortable taking a selfie, a photo from the bog that includes your student number written on a piece of paper with the bog clearly visible in the background is also sufficient to verify your visit.

2. Write a brief description of the bog (1 paragraph).  How does it compare (sights, sounds, smells) to the surrounding area (forest and residential neighborhood).

3. The Camosun Bog restoration group is interested in measuring the water balance of the bog to ensure their restoration efforts will be effective over the long-term in a changing climate.  They are considering installing an eddy covariance system, similar to the CA-DBB eddy covariance station in Burns Bog to measure evapotranspiration at the site.  Do you think this would be an effective approach at this location?  Why or why not?  *Hint* you can zoom out / pan / zoom in on the map from assignment 4 to view the Camosun Bog with high resolution satellite imagery.
