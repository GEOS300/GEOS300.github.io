### Question 2 

The plot below shows data from the January 2024 cold-snap (Jan 12 to Jan 19) and snowstorm (Jan 17) during which record low temperatures were observed and over 25cm of snow was received across the Metro Vancouver area.  Traces traces of the four radiation component, air & soil temperature, and relative humidity are shown.  Looking at the trace below - what stands out to you?  Comment on the progression of each radiative component over time, using the temperature and humidity data to support your discussion.  Do you see any issues in the data?  If so, what is a possible explanation?
