## Question 5

The maximum half-hourly $SW_\downarrow$ observed during this time period occurred between 12:30 and 13:00 on January 13th.  Using the equations from lecture, calculate the Local Apparent Time (LAT), solar declination $\delta$, solar zenith angle $Z$, and extraterrestrial irradiance $I_ex$ for the center point of this observation period (12:45).  Given the value of $I_ex$, compared to observed $SW_\downarrow$, what is the approximate bulk transmissivity ($\Psi_a$) coefficient of the atmosphere over CA-DBB at this point in time?  Given the value of $I_ex$, compared to observed $SW_\downarrow$, what is the approximate bulk transmissivity ($\Psi_a$) coefficient of the atmosphere over CA-DBB at this point in time?
