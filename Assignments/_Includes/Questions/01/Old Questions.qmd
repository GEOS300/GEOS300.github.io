(@) Estimate the approximate surface albedo of the grass surface for that day. Justify your calculation of the albedo. Do you observe any diurnal variation of the albedo? $\dagger$ [4]

%(@) Approximately 42\% of the energy in the short-wave is within the PAR band (Photosynthetically active radiation that can be used by plants to perform photosynthesis). Based on this assumption, calculate the energy available to plants (also called: photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD) at noon in $\mu \rm{mol}\, \rm{m}^{-2}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$. Hint: Consult examples in reading package Lectures 4 and 5. [2]

(@) Use the values presented in Lecture 7 Slide 5 to get an estimate of the surface emissivity $\varepsilon_{0}$ of a grass surface. Using this values, calculate the true surface temperature $T_0$ (i.e. considering that the surface is a grey body and reflects) at noon for the given day. [3]

(@) Find a way to calculate the `apparent' radiative sky temperature ($T_k$) in $^{\circ}\textrm{C}$ from the measured $L_{\downarrow}$ at noon (`apparent' means you should assume $\varepsilon_{a} = 1.0$). How would you interpret $T_k$? [2]

(@) Using measured $L_{\downarrow}$ and measured air temperature $T_a$, calculate the actual bulk emissivity of the atmosphere $\varepsilon_{a}$ at noon? [2]

(@) Using the Prata (1996) equation and measured $T_a$ and $RH$, what is the calculated apparent emissivity of the atmosphere and the calculated value of $L_{\downarrow}$ at the same time (noon)? Comment on reasons why the value of $\varepsilon_a$ determined in Question 11 and Prata (1996) may be different? [4]

(@) Graph a scatter plot of the measured incoming solar radiation ($K_{\downarrow}$) versus the net all-wave radiation ($Q^{\ast}$). If you only had values of $K_{\downarrow}$ available in the future does this relation provide a possible means of obtaining $Q^{\ast}$? When might it be least useful? Discuss. $\dagger$ [6]

$\dagger$ To answer questions marked by a $\dagger$ it is highly recommended to use a computer / graph software or R (or other programming language). See the course web-page for help documents on how to use the most common graph software or R. However, if you decide to not use a computer, it is appropriate to consider only the values at each full hour (i.e. 00:00, 01:00, 02:00 etc.) and manually calculate results / draw the graphs using this reduced data-set of 24 values.
