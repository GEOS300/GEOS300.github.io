### Question 8

Using the examples above as a template, create a new selection to see how typical summertime conditions compare to severe winter time conditions.  Change the selection period so that it spans July 12th to July 19th, 2023.  Provide summary statistics of the same variables as those shown above and produce plots like the ones shown above as well. Discuss how each of these variables during this mid-summer period compare to those from the cold-snap period.
