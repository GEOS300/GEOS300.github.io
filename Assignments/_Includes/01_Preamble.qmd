In this lab, assignment, you're going to look at data from the CA-DBB (aka "BB") Eddy Covariance (EC) Station @fig-BB1, located in Delta, BC.  Clicking on "BB" in @fig-map will zoom to the CA-DBB station and show the site's "Flux Footprint Climatology", which is a concept we'll cover later in term.  Clicking the "BB" button again will toggle the footprint later on and off.  You can pan/zoom to get a feel for what the site looks like.  For now, we'll stick to looking at some basic components of the site's energy balance.  In the data files (Climate_Summary_BB.csv & Climate_Summary_BB_Metadata.csv) you will find measurements multiple variables and their corresponding metadata.
