# This function can be used to calculate the "natural logarithm" (ln):
# log()

# Hint 2 >>
# The "lm" function can be used to estimate the slope (m) and intercept (b) of a line (Y=mX+b), 
# with the following syntax:
# fit=lm(Y~X)
# b=fit$coefficients[1]
# m=fit$coefficients[2]

# Hint 3 >>
# The following set of commands can add a new first row a table 
# 1) Crate a new table with one row (without data values)
# If you know the values you want to add, just replace np.nan with the value
#new_first_row = data.frame(Height..m. = NaN, Wind.Speed..m.s. = NaN)
# 2) Concatenate the new row to the top of the original table then reset the index
# Wind_Profile = rbind(new_first_row,Table_1)
