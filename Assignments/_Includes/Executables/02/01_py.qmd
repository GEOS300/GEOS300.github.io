# All sub-surface data were collected at the same frequency (15-minute intervals).  
# However, H data were only available at 30-minute resolution.  
# So we'll use a simple gap-filling procedure to estimate missing values from the nearest available observations.   
# Use linear interpolation to estimate missing H values where possible.

# Backfill where linear interpolation doesn't work (the first observation)
