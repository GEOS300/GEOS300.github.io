{{< include _imports.qmd >}}



![For any given weather condition, there is a theoretical equilibrium wind speed, called the geostrophic wind $G$, that can be calculated for frictionless conditions. However, steady-state winds in the ABL are usually slower than geostrophic (i.e., subgeostrophic) because of frictional and turbulent drag of the air against the surface.](images/16_1_8.jpg)



## Today’s learning objectives


* Describe how the mean velocity profile is linked to the momentum flux.
* Understand the ‘famous’ logarithmic wind profile equation.

::: {.notes}

The drag slows motion close to the ground and gives rise to a sharp decrease of mean horizontal wind speed (u) as the surface is approached. 
The force exerted on the surface by the air being dragged over it is called the surface shearing stress (tau ) and is expressed as a pressure (Pa, force per unit surface area). 
The surface layer of frictional influence generates this shearing force and transmits it downwards as a flux of momentum.

## Mixing Length {.smaller}


The characteristic height for mixing to occur is the mixing length $l$ and is likely related to the mean size of eddies.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Assume an eddy at level ($z+l$) with mean velocity $\bar{u}_{(z+l)}$ moves down to $z$ where mean velocity $\bar{u}_{(z)}$ is less, by $u^{\prime}$:

$$
u^{\prime} = \bar{u}_{(z+l)}-\bar{u}_{(z)}
$$

so:
$$
u^{\prime} = l\small\frac{\delta u}{\delta z}
$${#eq-Mixing-Length}

* i.e. extra velocity = increment in height x rate of change of velocity with height.

WRITE ON BOARD

Shear Velocity, also called friction velocity, is a form by which a shear stress may be re-written in units of velocity. It is useful as a method in fluid mechanics to compare true velocities, such as the velocity of a flow in a stream, to a velocity that relates shear between layers of flow.
Shear velocity is used to describe shear-related motion in moving fluids. It is used to describe:
Diffusion and dispersion of particles, tracers, and contaminants in fluid flows
The velocity profile near the boundary of a flow (see Law of the wall)
Transport of sediment in a channel

## von Kármán’s constant

So if the eddy size is proportional to the distance to the ground, let’s set $l=k(z)^b$, in neutral stability: $b = 1 \rightarrow l=kz$

* and therefore, substitution of $l$ into @eq-Mixing-Length-Log-Profile gives

$$
\frac{\delta \bar{u}}{\delta z} = \frac{u_*}{k}(z)^{-b} = \frac{u_*}{kz}
$${#eq-von-Karma-Definition}

* i.e. in @eq-Log-Profile-Law; $a=u_*/k$

The constant $k$ is von Kármán’s constant ($\approx$ 0.41)

## The logarithmic wind law {.smaller}

Integration of @eq-von-Karma-Definition requires knowledge of the exact height where is $\bar{u}$ zero (integration constant). In practice this depends on the roughness of the ground so we set a roughness length ($z_0$, units m) and restrict the equation to $z > z_0$.

## Semi-log paper {.smaller}


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

On this paper, you can directly enter wind velocity on the x-axis (linear scale) and height on the y-axis (logarithmic scale).


First label your own axes (orders of magnitude on y-axis) to fit data optimally on paper. Then enter data points.


You can fit a line (e.g. by hand using a ruler). The intercept with the y-axis gives you an estimate of z0.

## Wind profiles over different surfaces


![T.R. Oke (1987): 'Boundary Layer Climates' 2nd Edition.](images/16_25_3.gif)

::: {.notes}

Geostrophic
The depth of this layer increases with increasing roughness. Therefore the vertical gradient of mean wind speed (du/dz) is greatest over smooth terrain, and least over rough surfaces. 
Rougher surface we have, the lower the windspeed at a given height



:::



## Tall roughness {.smaller}

Over tall roughness elements (such as tall vegetation, orchards, forests) a dead zone in amongst the elements exists.

* This causes the form of the wind profile to diverge from observations, wind seems to go to zero at z >> z0.

## Zero-plane displacement $z_d$ {.smaller}


:::: {.columns}

## Estimating $z_d$ 




* It is possible to determine zd from analysis of wind observations:

  + Iteration using trial values to find $z_d$ which straightens plot $\bar{u}$ vs. $ln(z- z_d)$ under neutral conditions.

* A rule-of-thumb says: $z_d = 2/3 z_h$, but it omits density consideration.
  * $\bar{u}_z$ should reach zero at the height $z_d+z_0$. 
* However, this is not observed in vegetation canopies.
  * We observe wind speed > 0 even below $z_d+z_0$.

## The vertical profile of horizontal wind

In most canopies (forests, orchards, crops) we find the logarithmic wind profile well above the mean canopy height h, and an exponential profile within the canopy.

## The Exponential Wind Profile {.smaller}


:::: {.columns}

The mean wind profile inside homogeneous canopies can be approximated as exponential function (z < h):

$\alpha$ is an empirical constant, the canopy’s wind extinction coefficient.

## Take home points

* The wind profile in the surface layer follows the logarithmic law.
* The integration constant of the log-law is the roughness length z0, which depends on the surface’s roughness.
* Over tall roughness elements the straight line plot of ū vs. ln(z) breaks down - so we need to introduce an effective height of mean drag - zero plane displacement zd.
