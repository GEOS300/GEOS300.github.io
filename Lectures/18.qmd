## Covariance and flux densities (1/2)

The vertical flux density of an entity $c$ is defined as:

* Flux density = air density $\times$ vertical velocity $\times$ concentration of c 
* For some entity $c$, its average flux density is hence

* $F_c (m^{-2} s^{-1}) = \rho (kg\ m^{-3}) \times w (m s^{-1}) \times c (kg^{-1})$

::: {.notes}

The theory behind these measurements.
The eddy covariance method is based on the turbulent transport theory in the surface layer of the atmosphere and used to estimate scalar and energy fluxes from the covariance between the vertical wind speed and the gas concentration at a measured height above the surface.

All atmospheric entities show short-period fluctuations about their longer term mean value. This is the result of turbulence which causes eddies to move continually around carrying with them their properties derived elsewhere. 

extensive site mass continuity requires that as much air moves up as moves down over a reasonable period of time (e.g. 10 min); and the detail of the fluctuating trace gives the value of w0 at any instant as a positive or negative quantity depending upon whether it is above the mean (an updraft) or below it (a downdraft). 

The properties contained by, and therefore transported with, an eddy are its mass (which by considering unit volume is given by its density, (⇢), its vertical velocity (w) and the volumetric content of any entity it possesses (s). Since each one can be broken into a mean and a fluctuating part the mean vertical flux density of the entity (S) can therefore be written

First, all terms involving a single primed quantity are eliminated because by definition the average of all their fluctuations equals zero (i.e. we lose the second, third and fifth terms). 
Second, we may neglect terms involving fluctuations of density since air density is considered to be virtually constant in the lower atmosphere (i.e. we lose the sixth, seventh and eighth terms. 
Third, if observations are restricted to uniform terrain without areas of preferred vertical motion (i.e. no ‘hotspots’ or standing waves) we may neglect terms containing the mean vertical velocity, as w = 0 (i.e. we lose also the first term). With these assumptions equation 9.26 reduces to the form of the relation underlying the eddy fluctuation approach.

Mass trace gas flux(g m-2 s-1)

molar density(µmol m-3)


Molar trace gas flux(mol m-2 s-1)


Measuring trace gas fluxes


Molar trace gas flux(µmol m-2 s-1)


If we equip an eddy covariance system with an analyzer that measures fast fluctuations of the molar density of any trace gas ρc’ (e.g. µmol m-3) we can directly determine the gas-exchange (molar flux) between a land surface and the atmosphere:

Take home points

* By simultaneously measuring vertical wind and a concentration, we can measure turbulent fluxes using the eddy-covariance technique.
* Eddy-covariance can be used to directly measure the sensible heat flux density using QH = ρ cp w’T’
* We can track the flux of water vapour and measure the latent heat flux density using QE = Lv  w’ρv’
* To measure traces gas fluxes we use the covariance between the molar density and the vertical wind (w’ρc’)
* Eddy covariance observations can help inform carbon cycle & climate science
