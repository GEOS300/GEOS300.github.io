## Covariance and flux densities (1/2) {.smaller}

The vertical flux density of an entity $c$ is defined as:

* Flux density (amount of c $m^{-2} s^{-1}$) = air density ($kg\ m^{-3}$) $\times$ vertical velocity ($m s^{-1}$) $\times$ the amount of c (units vary)


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}



* For some entity $c$, the general form for average flux density is:

$$
F_c = \overline{\rho w c }
$${#eq-Flux-Density-General}



:::

::: {.column width="50%"}


*Recall:* applying Reynolds decomposition to each component:

$$
\begin{align}
\rho=\bar{\rho}+\rho^{\prime} \\ \nonumber
w=\bar{w}+w^{\prime} \\ \nonumber
c=\bar{c}+c^{\prime} \\ \nonumber
\end{align}
$$

::: {.notes}

The theory behind these measurements.
The eddy covariance method is based on the turbulent transport theory in the surface layer of the atmosphere and used to estimate scalar and energy fluxes from the covariance between the vertical wind speed and the gas concentration at a measured height above the surface.

All atmospheric entities show short-period fluctuations about their longer term mean value. This is the result of turbulence which causes eddies to move continually around carrying with them their properties derived elsewhere. 

Extensive site mass continuity requires that as much air moves up as moves down over a reasonable period of time (e.g. 10 min); and the detail of the fluctuating trace gives the value of w0 at any instant as a positive or negative quantity depending upon whether it is above the mean (an updraft) or below it (a downdraft). 

The properties contained by, and therefore transported with, an eddy are its mass (which by considering unit volume is given by its density, (⇢), its vertical velocity (w) and the volumetric content of any entity it possesses (s). Since each one can be broken into a mean and a fluctuating part the mean vertical flux density of the entity (S) can therefore be written 


:::


## Covariance and flux densities (2/2)

Close to the surface, $\bar{w} \rightarrow 0$ and $\rho^{\prime} \approx 0$, therefore, @eq-Flux-Density-General reduces to:

$$
F_c = \overline{\bar{\rho}w^{\prime}(\bar{c}+c^{\prime})} = \overline{\bar{\rho}(w^{\prime}\bar{c}+w^{\prime}c^{\prime})} \nonumber
$$

Recalling that $\overline{\bar{c}\times w^{\prime}} =0$; a flux density can be expressed in terms of the correlation coefficient:

$$
F_c = \rho \overline{w^{\prime}c^{\prime}}
$${#eq-Flux-Correlation}

::: {.notes}

First, all terms involving a single primed quantity are eliminated because by definition the average of all their fluctuations equals zero (i.e. we lose the second, third and fifth terms). 
Second, we may neglect terms involving fluctuations of density since air density is considered to be virtually constant in the lower atmosphere (i.e. we lose the sixth, seventh and eighth terms. 
Third, if observations are restricted to uniform terrain without areas of preferred vertical motion (i.e. no ‘hotspots’ or standing waves) we may neglect terms containing the mean vertical velocity, as w = 0 (i.e. we lose also the first term). With these assumptions equation 9.26 reduces to the form of the relation underlying the eddy fluctuation approach.
Redefine correlation coefficient
Flux  = turbulent fluctuations in vertical wind and the scalar, and then computing the covariance between the two.

## Measuring Sensible Heat Flux Density H by EC

The instantaneous sensible heat flux density is (in W m-2):

$$
H = C_a w^{\prime}T^{\prime}  \nonumber
$${#eq-Sensible-Heat-EC}

Averaging and substituting $\rho c_a$ gives:

$$
H = \rho c_a \overline{w^{\prime}T^{\prime}}

## Latent heat flux density LE


The instantaneous latent heat flux density is (in W m-2):

$$
LE = L_v w^{\prime}\rho_v^{\prime} \nonumber
$${#eq-Latent-Heat-EC}

Where $\rho_v$ is the partial vapor density of water (aka absolute humidity) and $L_v$ is the latent heat of vaporization in $J \ kg^{-1}$ (see next slide).  Averaging gives:

$$
LE = L_v \overline{w^{\prime}\rho_v^{\prime}}

## Mass trace gas flux

If we equip an eddy covariance system with an analyzer that measures fast fluctuations of the **molar density** of any trace gas $\rho_c^{\prime}$ (e.g. µmol m-3) we can directly determine the gas-exchange (molar flux) between a land surface and the atmosphere:


$$
F_c = \overline{w^{\prime}\rho_c^{\prime}}
$${#eq-Gas-FLux-EC}


To convert a molar trace gas flux to a mass flux, you multiply by the molar mass M ($\rm{g} \ \rm{mol}^{-1}$) of the compound.  For example the molar mass of $\rm{CO}_2$ is 44.01 $\rm{g} \ \rm{mol}^{-1}$

## Net Ecosystem Exchange

Fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) are of particular concern for micrometeorologists, climate scientists, and ecologists because of the role ecosystem-scale CO<sub>2</sub> exchange plays in the global climate system.

* Measurements of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) are an important component of monitoring the effects of an predicting the progression of climate change!

## Chamber measurements of GHG fluxes

Chambers placed over the soil can measure soil GHG fluxes at even smaller scales.  This requires placing the chamber on top of the soil and measuring the change in gas concentration over time

## Chamber measurements of GHG fluxes

Fluxes are calculated based on the change in gas concentration over time (i.e., the slope of the line labeled data).

## Take Home Points



* By simultaneously measuring vertical wind and a concentration, we can measure turbulent fluxes using the eddy-covariance technique.
* Eddy-covariance can be used to directly measure the sensible heat flux density using $H = \rho c_a w’T’$
* We can track the flux of water vapour and measure the latent heat flux density using $LE = L_v  w’ρv’$
* To measure traces gas fluxes we use the covariance between the molar density and the vertical wind (w’ρc’)
* Eddy covariance observations can help inform carbon cycle & climate science
