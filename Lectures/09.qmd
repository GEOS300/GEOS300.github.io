## Sub-Surface Temperature Profile

::: {.notes}

The course of soil temperature at a particular depth Tz with time is very regular in comparison with almost any other atmospheric element. 
What direction is our soil heat flux?
Geothermal gradient is the rate of increasing temperature with respect to increasing depth in the Earth's interior. The Earth's internal heat comes from a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion, heat produced through radioactive decay, latent heat from core crystallization, and possibly heat from other sources.

## Soil Temperature Waves {.smaller}


The daily and annual periodic forcing by the sun creates a surface temperature ($T_o$) wave, which propagates into the soil below. If we make the following assumptions:

1. The thermal diffusivity κ = k/C is uniform
2. Cycles are sinusoidal (better for year than day)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}


Then then $T_o$ at time $t$ (in seconds) over period $P$ can be approximated as:

{{< include ../_Equations/Sinusoidal-Temperature-Wave.qmd >}}

where $\overline{T_o}$ is the mean surface temperature over $P$, $\Delta T_o$ is the wave amplitude ($\small\frac{1}{2}$ range of $T_o$), and the angular frequency of oscillation is $\omega = 2\pi / P$.

## A Solution of Fourier’s Heat Conduction {.smaller}
 
With the surface temperature wave equation as the boundary condition, we can find an analytic solution to the Fourier heat conduction equation in 1-D:


{{< include ../_Equations/Phase-Shifted-Sinusoidal-Temperature-Wave.qmd >}}

* **exponential term**: Wave amplitude at depth z relative to the surface temperature wave
* **sine function**: Phase shift of the wave at depth z

*Note*: the wave decays exponentially with depth, and the decay is less in soils with large κ, or if the period is longer.


::: {.notes}

Boundary conditions (b.c.) are constraints necessary for the solution of a boundary value problem. They are a set of additional constraints.
Omega = angular frequency
thermal diffusivity = how fast a temperature wave will diffuse or travel downward into a soil


:::



## Damping Depth {.smaller}


The inverse of the exponential term defines a useful feature, the **damping depth** ($D$).

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

* It is the depth at which the surface temperature wave is reduced to $e^{-1}$ (37%) of its value at z = 0.
* At 3D it drops below 5%, and 4.6 D below 1%.

::: {.notes}

In most soils the daily surface temperature wave is only discernible to a depth of about 0.75 m. In soils with low κ values it is even less, indicating that flux convergence has extinguished QG in a thin near-surface layer.

Note, the wave decays exponentially with depth, and the decay is less in soils with large κ, or if the period is longer.

## Phase Shift - Max and Min Soil Temperatures {.smaller}

Term 2 of the 1-D analytical solution (@eq-Phase-Shifted-Sinusoidal-Temperature-Wave) gives the phase shift equation for features such as maximum and minimum soil temperatures, which occurs at 0.5 π and 1.5 π, i.e.:

* $\sin(\omega t - (\small\frac{\omega}{2K})^{1/2}z) = \pm 1$

Solving for $t$ gives:

$\Delta t_m = t_{m_2} - t_{m_1} = (z_2 - z_1)(\small\frac{1}{2\omega K})^{1/2}$


$\Delta t_m$ is the phase shift; $t_{m_1}$ and $t_{m_2}$ are times at which maximum or minimum soil temperatures occur at $z_1$ and $z_2$ respectively.






::: {.notes}

The time lag (phase shift) for the wave crest (maximum) and trough (minimum) to reach lower depths is given by 
where t1 and t2 are the times at which the wave crest or trough reaches depths z1 and z2. 



:::




## Phase Shift (iClicker)

When will soil temperature reaches its maximum at 5 cm if the maximum surface temperature is measured at 13:00? Assume a thermal diffusivity K = 5.0×10−7 m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>.

```{R}
# Calculate phase shift for one day
z1 = 0.0 #soil surface
z2 = 0.1 #any depth(e.g., 10 cm)
K = 5e-7 #thermal conductivity

delta_tm = (0.05-0)*(1/(2*omega_d*K))**0.5
```

`r T <- 13.0+delta_tm/3600`

* A `r delta_tm`
* B `r T`
* c `r sprintf('%.0f:%.0f',floor(T),(T%%1)*60)`

## Phase shift (Implications) {.smaller}


* The phase shift at a certain depth is least in soils with large κs. 
* These idealized patterns are disrupted by:
* Variable cloud cover.
* Rain (percolation gives wetting front).
* Freezing/melting (latent heat effects).
* Snow cover (insulates).
* Soil inhomogeneities in the horizontal and vertical.


## Modification and Control of Soil Climates {.smaller}


Relatively little can be done economically to modify the external forcing (shade is an exception). But the nature of the soil can be manipulated.

*  **Albedo** - surface dressing with dark or light-cultured materials.
*  **Ridge and furrows** - control surface geometry to maximize or minimize K* and L* and surface moisture state.
*  **Moisture** - wetting or drainage can greatly alter thermal properties.
*  **Compaction / cultivation** - control of air content and its role in thermal properties.

The furrow and ridge geometry enhances the irradiance of solar radiation on the sloped sides 
The furrow and ridge geometry enhances shortwave absorption by decreasing the system albedo (multiple reflection) 
The furrow and ridge geometry reduces long-wave loss by L∗ due to a reduced sky view factor

## Heat Sharing

The partitioning of total ‘sensible’ heat flux between the soil ($H_g$) and the atmosphere ($H$).

{{< include ../_Equations/Heat-Sharing.qmd >}}

* Soil and atmosphere share in accepting heat during daytime and releasing heat at night.  $\mu_g$ and $\mu_a$ are the soil and atmospheric thermal admittance respectively.

  + $\mu_a$ increases with wind speed and convection (mixing).

## Take home points

* We observe temperature waves with annual, diurnal and even short-term (cloud-passage) periods.
* In a uniform soil, the wave amplitude decays exponentially, whereas the phase-shift is linear with depth.
* The damping depth is a commonly used term to quantify the depth to which 37% of the surface amplitude reaches down.
