* To describe land-atmosphere exchange of heat, mass and momentum we can identify resistances of different sub-processes, e.g. of plant components (leaf, xylem, root, etc.), soil, whole PBL, etc.
* Resistance relate the flux to a measured difference Δs across part of a system. For a given difference:
* Low resistance - high flux densityHigh resistance - low flux density

We can define a scalar flux ($F_c$ in $m^{-2} s^{-1}$) in terms of storage ($\Delta S$ in $m^{-3}$) and either resistance ($r$ in $s m^{-1}$) or conductance ($g$ in $m s^{-1}$):

## Resistances at the surface-atmosphere interface {.smaller}


* Several types of resistances / conductances can be conceived of, depending on the transport processes in the layer, e.g.
* $r_a$ (or $g_a$) - aerodynamic resistance (conductance) in the turbulent surface layer. Depends on degree of turbulent activity.
* $r_b$ (or $g_b$) - laminar boundary layer resistance (conductance) in the LBL immediately adjacent to surfaces. Depends on molecular diffusivities and thickness is the key variable.
* $r_s$ (or $g_s$) - stomatal resistance (conductance) of leaf pores. Depends on stomatal aperture (light, T, VPD, $CO_2$ conc., leaf water potential)
* $r_c$ (or $g_c$) - canopy or surface resistance (conductance). Integrated resistance of complete surface system including $r_s$ and $r_b$ of leaves and air in canopy.

* For small-scale turbulence, the flux is down the concentration gradient, i.e

Boussinesq suggested that turbulent transfer could be considered analogous to molecular diffusion - eddies replace molecules: 

* Flux density  = transfer efficiency $\times$ gradient of entity

It should be recognized that the above gradient-transport relations are not the expressions of any sound physical laws in the same sense that their molecular counterparts are. These are not based on any rigorous theory, but only on an intuitive assumption of similarity or analogy between molecular and turbulent transfers. Under ordinary circumstances, one would expect heat to flow from warmer to colder regions, roughly in proportion to the temperature gradient.

## K-Theory - limitations {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

* K’s are extremely variable in time, space and atmospheric conditions (stability).
* Requires instruments capable of measuring small vertical gradients (differences) to high accuracy.
* Also the K-theory does not account for counter-gradient transport. 
  + In the atmosphere, sometimes fluxes are counter gradient. Due to a large eddies which (briefly) transport flux regardless of background average (e.g. within plant canopies)

eddy diffusivities 
The observation of a secondary wind maxima suggests counter-gradient transfer since momentum transfer is directed downward and is diminishing with depth, despite the local increase in wind velocity. It also led to a major finding that K theory is wrong, when applied in vegetation. Wilson and Shaw [N R Wilson and Shaw, 1977] applied a second order closure model to assess this phenomenon.

## Reynolds Analogy {.smaller}

Reynolds surmised that in fully turbulent flow (high $R_e$) eddies would carry entities with equal ease (similarity principle):

$K_m = K_H = K_v = K_c$

* and consequently, over the same layer

$r_{am} = r_{aH} = r_{av} = r_{ac}$

* Practically this implies that we must only determine one of the K’s 

* Generally held that close to the ground this applies, except that $K_M$ becomes increasingly dissimilar as instability increases, and then:            

$K_x \propto K_M^2$

## Reynolds Analogy

If we assume a similarity, we can take ratios of flux-gradient equations, and eliminate the K’s. If one flux is known (usually $\tau$ from a measured wind profile), we can obtain other if their gradients are measured, e.g.

$$
\frac{\tau}{H} = \frac{\cancel{\rho}\cancel{K_M}(\Delta\bar{u}/\cancel{\Delta z})}{-\cancel{\rho}c_a\cancel{K_H}(\Delta\bar{\Theta}/\cancel{\Delta z})} = \frac{\Delta \bar{u}}{-c_a \Delta \bar{\Theta}}

* where $C_a = \rho c_a$

## Aerodynamic Approach {.smaller}

The aerodynamic approach requires the measurement [or prediction in a model] of mean wind u and relevant property (e.g. potential temperature $\Theta$ absolute humidity $\rho_v$ ) at same two heights [or layers].  It relies on the similarity of $K_M$ and $K_x$.

## Aerodynamic Approach ( 1/3)

From the neutral wind law:

$$
\bar{u_2} =\frac{u*}{k} (ln z_2 - ln z_0) \\ \nonumber
\bar{u_1} =\frac{u*}{k} (ln z_1 - ln z_0) \\ \nonumber
(\bar{u_2} - \bar{u_1})=\frac{u*}{k} (ln z_2 - ln z_1) \nonumber
$$

rearranging:

$$
\frac{\Delta \bar{u}}{ln(z_2/z_1)} = u_*/k
$${#eq-Aerodynamic-Approach}

## Aerodynamic Approach ( 2/3)


Since $\tau \approx \rho u_*^2$; we can redefine:

$$
\tau = \rho k^2 [\Delta\bar{u}/ln(z_2/z_1)]^2
$${#eq-Tau-Redef}

And substitute @eq-Tau-Redef into @eq-Reynolds-Analogy and solve $H$




## Aerodynamic Approach ( 3/3) {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}

For Sensible Heat Flux ($H$):

$$
\begin{align}
H&=\frac{-\tau c_a \Delta\bar{\Theta}}{\Delta\bar{u}} \\ \nonumber
 &=\frac{-\rho k^2 \Delta\bar{u}^2c_a \Delta\bar{\Theta}}{\Delta\bar{u}[ln(z_2/z_1)]^2} \\ \nonumber
 &=\frac{-\rho k^2 \Delta\bar{u} c_a \Delta\bar{\Theta}}{[ln(z_2/z_1)]^2}
\end{align}
$${#eq-Aerodynamic-H}

For Latent Heat Flux ($LE$):

$$
LE = -\frac{L_v k^2 \Delta\bar{u} \Delta\bar{\rho_v}}{[ln(z_2/z_1)]^2}
$$

## Take Home Points {.smaller}


* Resistance allow us to handle the flow of energy and mass though a complex system such as a land-atmosphere interface. Resistances can be formulated in series or in parallel.
* Resistance formulations and flux-gradient relations (using eddy diffusivities, i.e. K’s) can be used to describe sensible, latent heat and trace gas transfer.
* Reynolds analogy assumes that the eddy diffusivities for different scalars are similar, i.e. $K_M$ = $K_H$ = $K_E$ = $K_C$ 
* This allows us to overcome the severe restrictions of using K-theory - as in the aerodynamic approach the K’s cancel out.
