Radiation of wavelength λ incident upon an object must either be transmitted through it or be reflected from its surface, or be absorbed. This is a statement of the conservation of energy.

To calculate $SW_\downarrow$ at Earth's surface, we need to know the effect of the atmosphere in depleting solar radiation.


![](images/WreckBeach.jpg)


::: {.notes}

The Atmosphere depletes the solar beam as it passes through by an amount depending upon the length of its path, and the properties of the air. 
Gases, droplets and particles (especially ozone, water vapour, dust, clouds and smoke) have their own set of radiative properties with respect to the incident short-wave radiation, thus part of the beam is reflected (scattered), a part is absorbed and the rest is transmitted to the surface.

A differential solid angle, indicated as dω (omega), delimits a cone in space
So a sphere measures 4π steradians. Likewise a steradian is 1/12.57, or about 8% of a sphere.

Consider the power (P) being emitted from a source which is directed in a particular direction along the center of a cone that encompasses the solid angle, the radiant intensity is equal to the emitted power.

m = 1/cos(Z); so the greater the solar zenith angle, the greater the optical air mass, and the more attenuated the radiation at the surface.
To account for the effects of altitude values of m should be multiplied by the ratio of the station atmospheric pressure to that at standard sea-level (101.3 kPa).

Reflectivity is the fraction of incident radiation reflected by a surface
The reflectance characteristics of Earth’s surface features may be quantified by measuring the portion of incident energy that is reflected
This is measured as a function of wavelength (λ) and is called spectral reflectance (rλ )
Water (in soil, vegetation or water bodies) absorbs radiation at near-IR wavelengths and beyond (strong absorption bands at about 1.4, 1.9 and 2.7 μm)

Middle is absorptivity 
The relative roles of reflectivity (αλ), transmissivity (ψλ) and absorptivity (ζλ) are governed by the structure of the leaf interior and the radiative properties of the main plant pigments (especially chlorophyll) 
Absorb in the blue (0.40-0.51) and red (0.61-0.70); the waveband between 0.40 and 0.70 μm is therefore designated as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)
αλ decreases with increasing water content. The strong absorption bands at 1.45 and 1.95 μm are due to water.
On the other hand, in the near infrared (NIR) high reflectivity enables the leaf to reject the bulk of the incident energy. The heat content of this radiation is very high but it is not useful for photosynthesis, therefore its rejection is helpful in offsetting the heat load on the leaf. 

The high emissivity at longer wavelengths also helps the leaf to shed heat to the environment and keep leaf temperatures moderate.
The cellular structure tends to cause almost totally diffuse scattering. This results in almost = portions of the radiation being reflected back & transmitted on through the leaf and explains why the αλ and ψλ curves in Figure 2 are similar in shape

The above image shows the NDVI anomaly in the U.S. for August 1993. In that year, heavy rain in the Northern Great Plains (North and South Dakota, Alberta, and Saskatchewan) led to flooding in the Missouri River.

Concurrently, in the Eastern U.S., rainfall was very low, and the region exhibited a strong negative anomaly (dark red).

::: {.notes}

The albedo (α) of a vegetation stand is lower than the value for its individual leaves because reflection depends not only on the radiative properties of the component surfaces, but also upon the stand architecture and the angle of solar incidence.
The latter two factors control the amount of penetration, radiation trapping, and mutual shading within the stand volume. 
Thus although most leaves have an albedo of about 0.30 the albedo of crops and other vegetation communities is less, and to some extent a function of their height. 
For most agricultural crops and natural vegetation less than 1 m in height the albedo lies in the remarkably narrow range from 0.18 to 0.25.

For short-wave beam radiation (S) most natural surfaces act as diffuse reflectors for solar elevation angle greater than 30◦ but may become increasingly specular for smaller angles. This is especially true for relatively smooth surfaces such as water, ice, snow, etc. 
Natural surfaces show very little directionality for diffuse radiation (D).

## Albedo as a Function of Solar Altitude

::: {.notes}

Early morning and evening albedos are higher, and when plotted versus the position of the Sun in the sky show a characteristic curve (Figure 3). 
higher probability that photons can leave the snowpack if they hit the surface at grazing angles.
The diurnal variation of the albedo is much less with cloudy skies. 

Its role in explaining seasonal variations of albedo is obscured by changes in plant phenology, snow, etc. 
However, since the highest albedos occur at the times of low energy input the effect of this diurnal variation on the total radiation budget is small. 
This dependence upon the solar altitude also explains why tropical albedos are usually less than those for similar surfaces at higher latitudes, and accounts for the observation that the diurnal variation of the albedo is much less with cloudy skies. 

This-pair-share: to get a robust estimate of α, students can either take the value at noon, the median value of the entire day, or do an average for a subset around midday. Also acceptable is the use of the daily totals or sums, i.e. α = sumK ↑ /sumK ↓.

## Take home points

* As short-wave radiation passes through the atmosphere, it is reflected, scattered and absorbed.
* At the surface, we therefore experience diffuse irradiance in addition direct-beam irradiance. 
* The transmission of direct-beam radiation can be described by a slab approach using a bulk atmospheric transmissivity.
* As short-wave radiation reaches a surface, part of it is reflected - can be quantified by spectral reflectivity and the reflection coefficient (called albedo for short-wave)
* Albedo is controlled by the material, 3D form, the leaf state and the presence of snow.
* Reflection can be specular and/or diffuse - and most natural surfaces become increasingly specular at low solar altitudes.
* Changing the albedo of a surface (material, geometry) is a powerful tool to microclimate modification.
