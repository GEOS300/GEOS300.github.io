# The SI System

The SI (Système International d’Unités or International System of Units) is the official unit system in science and therefore mandatory in climatology. This system uses a small number of base units from which other derived units can be obtained.  The SI base units are listed in @tbl-si-Base and should be used whenever applicable in this course.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-si-Base
#| tbl-cap: "SI Base Units."
#| tbl-colwidths: [25,35,40]


SI <- read.csv(file = '../_Data/SI_Units.csv', check.names = FALSE)

kable(SI)

```

* The unit for temperature is Kelvin (K, *not* $^{\circ} K$). Temperatures may be also indicated in degree Celsius ( $^{\circ} C$ ). However, temperature-differences should be referred to as Kelvin (K).  The conversion is listed in @eq-Kelvin.  Note how one Kelvin is equivalent to one degree Celsius, but the units have different zero points.
  * 0 K represents **absolute zero**, which is the **lowest possible temperature**: i.e., a complete lack of energy in a system.
    * Kelvin is on a ratio scale: it starts at a fixed, meaningful zero value and can only take positive values.  This allows for relative comparisons between values: 
      * e.ge., 100 K is "twice as hot" as 50 K
  * $^{\circ} C$ is the freezing point of fresh water at 1 atm (mean atmospheric pressure at sea level).
    * Celsius is on an interval scale > it has an arbitrary zero value and can take positive or negative values.  This **prevents** relative comparisons between values: 
      * e.ge., 100 $^{\circ} C$ **is not** "twice as hot" as 50 $^{\circ} C$

* You can use the following equation to convert between Celsius and Kelvin:

## Derived Units

Derived units can then be formed and related to base units by the process of multiplication or division using unity as the only multiplying factor.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-si-Derived
#| tbl-cap: "SI Derived Units."
#| tbl-colwidths: [25,35,40]


SID <- read.csv(file = '../_Data/Derived_Units.csv', check.names = FALSE)

kable(SID)

```

# Scientific Notation

Scientific notation can be used to modify SI base units and make very large/small numbers more readable by presenting them more concisely.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-times
#| tbl-cap: "Meeting day/time by lab section."
#| tbl-colwidths: [25,35,40]


SN <- read.csv(file = '../_Data/ScientificNotation.csv', check.names = FALSE)

kable(SN)

```

# Wind References


* Winds are named after the direction from which the air is moving.
* Example: if the wind direction is 45 degrees, wind is from Northeast.
