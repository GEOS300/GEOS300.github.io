* The geographic distribution of radiant energy is not equally distributed on Earth:
  * Large scales (Earth’s geometry) 
  * Small scales (topography)

Electromagnetic waves. Radiation can be described as a form of energy due to the rapid oscillations of electromagnetic fields. The oscillations may be considered as travelling waves characterized by their wavelength λ (distance between successive wavecrests). 
Radiation is able to travel in a vacuum, and all radiation moves at the speed of light (c=3×108 ms−1), and in a straight path. Hence, instead of wavelength, we can express radiation by its frequency ν (in oscillations per second, i.e. s−1) (v = c/λ)
We’re typically concerned with 0.1 to 100 μm with visible from 0.4 to 0.7 μm 
Particle properties. Radiation can be also described by discrete bundles of energy that have properties similar to particles. Quantum physics tells us that radiation is transferred as discrete packets called quanta (or photons if in the visible part of the spectrum). 
Energy of quantum is e = h ν. (h = Plancks constant (6.63 × 10-34 J s))
Plants can only use photons in the visible range of the spectrum which is also called photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 0.4 - 0.7 μm).

## Shortwave vs. Longwave

![](images/04_11_3.jpg)

::: {.notes}

All bodies possessing energy (i.e. whose temperatures are above absolute zero, 0 K = −273.2◦C) emit radiation. 
Total radiant heat energy emitted from a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature
Wein’s displacement law: It states that a rise in the temperature of a body not only increases the total radiant output, but also increases the proportion of shorter wavelengths of which it is composed. 
Kirchhoff’s law: Emissivity = absorptivity

Declination: The earth's equator is tilted 23.45 degrees with respect to the plane of the earth's orbit around the sun, so at various times during the year, as the earth orbits the sun, declination varies from 23.45 degrees north to 23.45 degrees south. This gives rise to the seasons.
Meridian: meridian (or line of longitude)

:::

## Calculating Solar Declination {.smaller}

$\delta$ only depends upon day of year, which gives returns $\delta$ in radians
 

* The equation is complex due to the non-circular orbit of Earth

{{< include ../_Equations/Solar-Declination.qmd >}}

::: {.notes}

One radian is just under 57.3 degrees.
Radians = 180/pi
The declination angle, denoted by δ, varies seasonally due to the tilt of the Earth on its axis of rotation and the rotation of the Earth around the sun

NOTE: Simple approximation has angle in radians (2pi) whereas answers to study questions has it in degrees (360).

* **Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**: standard time, referenced to mean solar time at the prime meridian.
* **Standard Time (LST)** - What is on your watch without daylight savings offset - same for all longitudes within a given time zone.
* **Local Mean Solar Time (LMST)** - Mean solar time is fixed and ensures that on average, highest solar altitude is observed at noon (not at each day of the year). Changes with longitude.
* **Local Apparent Time (LAT)** - A non-uniform time that varies through the year according to the equation of time. It ensures that highest solar altitude is always observed at noon.


## Local Mean Solar Time

Add (subtract) 4 min to LST for each degree of longitude east (west) of the standard meridian of the time zone.

## Take home points


* We discussed a lengthy recipe to predict the relative position of the sun with reasonable accuracy, taking geometry and astronomical parameters into account.
* We combined cosine law of illumination (GEOB 200, ATSC 201) with the solar constant to calculate extraterrestrial irradiance at any given time and for any location.
* In the next lecture we will add the effects of the atmosphere with the goal to predict surface irradiance.
